<p class="no-indent">The historical information contained in this volume has been
in a large measure collected from the Press of the period, and
chiefly from the <cite>Times</cite>, <cite>Liverpool Mercury</cite>, <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>,
and <cite>Chambers’ Journal</cite>. Lindsay’s “<cite>Merchant Shipping</cite>,” a
most admirable work, has also been consulted, as well as other
works of a similar nature. The name of the authority quoted
has been given in most cases, but, where I have been unable to
do so, I trust this general acknowledgment will suffice.</p>

<p>Some of the chapters in Part II. were contributed in 1901
to the <cite>Journal of Commerce</cite>, as part of a series of articles on
“Historical Steamship Companies.” Chapter XXII. in Part I.
was published in the May number (1903) of the <cite>Wide World
Magazine</cite>, under the title of “The Strange Case of the
<span class="smcap">Ferret</span>.”</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of thanking the Directors, Managers,
Agents, and other officials of the various Steamship Companies
referred to, by all of whom, and at all times, I have been
treated with the utmost courtesy. I desire also to express my
appreciation of the uniform kindness and assistance received
from the Librarians of the Bootle, Glasgow, and Liverpool
Libraries in placing at my disposal publications, some of
which were printed nearly a hundred years ago.</p>

<p class="no-indent">There is not a more fascinating page in history than that which
tells of the growth of the Mercantile Steam Navies of the World.
It is a record of the triumphs of Science and Art in Marine
Architecture; of bold enterprises—not always carried to a
successful financial issue; of deeds of “derring do” as romantic
as the older stories of the Vikings. It is a page brightened by
stories of true heroism, where men have bravely faced death,
not in the lust of battle, but in calm devotion to duty, or in
unflinching determination to save the lives of those weaker
than themselves.</p>

<p>It is not possible, nor would it answer any useful purpose,
to discuss fully the various claims which have been put forward
for the honour of having invented the first Marine Steam
Engine. It will be sufficient to refer briefly to the inventors,
or alleged inventors, prior to the year 1807.</p>

<p>In the Appendix to Señor Navarette’s “History of the Four
Voyages of Columbus,” are copies of certain documents which
the historian vouches to be authentic extracts from the series
of Spanish Records preserved at Simancas. These documents
narrate “that in the month of May or June, 1543, Blasco de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Garay, a naval captain in the service of the Emperor
Charles V., conducted at Barcelona, a series of experiments
upon the applicability to ships of a certain propulsive
force, which he alleges he had himself discovered.”
De Garay describes the mechanism he employed as consisting
of two wheels, one attached to either extremity of a movable
axis which traversed the vessel’s waist, and was connected with
a large caldron of boiling water. The experiments, it is
alleged, were conducted in the presence of several persons of
high birth, deputed by the Emperor to witness them, and
amongst whom were many naval commanders. It is further
alleged that De Garay succeeded in taking to sea a vessel of
two hundred tons burthen, without the aid of sail or oar, and
that her speed was about one league per hour.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Geo. Preble, U.S.N., author of a “History of
Steam Navigation,” gives the names of several persons who
have searched the documents referred to, none of whom have
been able to trace any mention of steam; he, therefore, concludes
that the account of De Garay’s invention is a Spanish
legend.

Papin, who was driven from France by the revocation of
the Edict of Nantes, and was elected F.R.S. in 1681, describes,
in 1690, a steam cylinder in which a piston descends by
atmospheric pressure, and, as one of its uses, he mentions the
propulsion of ships by paddle wheels. Towards the close of
the 17th century, or the beginning of the 18th, Papin made
the acquaintance of Thomas Savory, one of the most ingenious
men of his times, and of Thomas Newcomen, a working blacksmith,
of Devon. Savory designed a marine engine, which
was greatly improved by Newcomen in 1705, and was used by
Papin to propel a steamboat on the Fulda.</p>

<p>Thirty years later (1736), Jonathan Hulls, of Berwick-on-Tweed,
received a patent for the first steamboat of which there
is any authentic record from George II., which recited as
follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>“Whereas our trusty and well-beloved Jonathan Hulls
hath by his petition humbly represented unto our most
dearly beloved Consort, the Queen, that he hath, with
much labour and with great expense, invented and
formed a machine for towing ships and vessels out of, or
into any harbour or river, against wind or tide, or in a
calm, which the petitioner apprehends may be of great
service to our Royal Party and merchant ships, and to
boats and other vessels, of which the petitioner hath
made oath that he is the sole inventor, as by affidavit to
his said petition annexed.</p>

<p>“Know ye, therefore, that we, of our special grace, hath
given and granted to the said Jonathan Hulls our
special license, full power, sole privilege and authority
during the term of fourteen years, and he shall lawfully
make use of the same for carrying ships and other
vessels out to sea, or into any harbour or river.</p>

<p>“In witness whereof we have caused these our letters to
be made patent.</p>

<p class="center">“(Witness) <span class="smcap">Caroline</span>,</p>
<p class="right">“Queen of Great Britain, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Given by right of Privy Seal at Westminster, this
21st day of December, 1736.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the description of his invention, Hulls states that, in his
opinion, it would not be practicable to place his machine on
anything but a tow-boat, as it would take up too much room
for other goods to be carried on the same vessel with it, and it
could not “be used in a storm, or when the waves are very
raging.” Hulls’ vessel is stated to have been a stern-wheeler,
a type of steamboat which is now extensively used for
navigating shallow rivers in the Southern States of America
and in India. The steam tow-boat brought its inventor
nothing but ridicule, and he died in London in almost destitute
circumstances.</p>

<p>Next in chronological sequence come the Abbé Arnal and
the Marquis de Jouffroy, of France, who, in 1781, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
experiments to show the practicability of applying steam
power to vessels.</p>

<p>Two years later (1783), a Mr. Fitch tried a species of steam
boiler on board a small nine-ton vessel on the Delaware River
in America, propelling the vessel by paddles.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>“In 1787 he
built another boat, 45ft. by 12ft., and fitted her with a 12in.
cylinder. With this vessel he is reported to have made the
trip from Philadelphia to Burlington at an average rate of
seven miles per hour. In 1790 he completed another and a
larger boat.” But all his plans failed, and, like Hulls, his
contemporaries deemed him to be crazy. He died in 1798.
<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
About this period (1780 to 1788) there resided in Edinburgh
a banker, of aristocratic birth and connection. Patrick
Miller, the banker referred to, was a man of an active and
ingenious mind, and, having realised a large fortune by
banking, he used it as a means of enabling him to work out
schemes for the benefit of the public. Having purchased an
estate in the beautiful valley of the Nith, from which he
derived the title of Laird of Dalswinton, he retired thither to
solve the problem of navigating a vessel by some more certain
means than oars and sails. He had (prior to this)<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>“exhibited
a triple vessel at Leith, having rotatory paddles in the two
interspaces, driven by a crank and wrought by four men. He
determined one day to try its powers against a fast sailing
Customs Wherry, between Inch-colm and the harbour of
Leith, a distance of six or seven miles. He beat his
opponent by several minutes, and was very well satisfied
with the result. His boys’ tutor, a Mr. Taylor, who had
taken his turn at the crank, and realised how violent was the
necessary exertion, was convinced that without a more
staying power than manual labour the invention would prove
practically useless. He stated his objections to Mr. Miller,
and they had frequent discussions on the subject. At length,
one day, Taylor said ‘Mr. Miller, I can suggest no power
equal to the steam engine, or so applicable to your purpose.’
The result of this suggestion was that Mr. Miller decided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
fit up a new double boat, which he had recently placed on
the lake at Dalswinton for the amusement of his family.
Taylor made the necessary arrangements under the direction
of an ingenious mechanic named William Symington. The
engine was a very small one, having four-inch brass
cylinders, made by George Watt, brassfounder, Edinburgh.
On the 14th October, 1788, several hundreds of people
assembled on the banks of Dalswinton Loch to witness the
trial trip of the twin steamboat, which was entirely
successful. Mr. Miller was so pleased with the success of
the experiment that he resolved to repeat it on a larger scale.
The following year he fitted a twin vessel 60 feet long,
belonging to himself, with an engine of 18in. cylinders.
This vessel steamed at the rate of seven miles an hour on the
Forth and Clyde Canal, in the presence of a vast multitude
of spectators. It had been Mr. Miller’s wish to try a third
experiment with a third vessel, in which he should venture
out on to the ocean, and attempt a passage from Leith to
London. Unfortunately, he became dissatisfied with
Symington, and, being vexed at the cost of fitting up the
second vessel, which was much greater than he anticipated,
as well as by a miscalculation, through which the machinery
was made too heavy for the hulls, he hesitated to make
further trial.”</p>

<p>“Taylor being poor, and a scholar, not a mechanician, could
do nothing without Mr. Miller’s assistance. Symington was
the only one of the three who persevered. He deserves
credit for having done so, but not for the manner in which
he did it, for without any communication with Messrs.
Miller and Taylor, the true inventors, he took out a patent
for the construction of steamboats in 1801. Through the
interest of Lord Dundas, he was able, in 1803, to fit up a new
steamboat for the Forth and Clyde Canal Co., and this vessel,
called the <span class="smcap">Charlotte Dundas</span>, was tried in towing a couple
of barges upon the canal with entire success, except in one
respect, which was that the agitation of the water by the
paddles was found to wash down the banks in an alarming
manner. For this reason the Canal Co. resolved to give up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the project, and the vessel was, therefore, laid aside. It lay
on the bank at Lock 16 for many years, generally looked on,
of course, as a monument of misdirected ingenuity, but, as
we shall presently see, it did not lie there altogether in vain.
Meantime Symington had been in communication with the
Duke of Bridgewater, with the object of introducing steam
towage on the Bridgewater Canal, and had actually received
a trial order, when, unfortunately, the Duke died, and the
project was closed. Here Symington vanishes likewise from
the active part of this history. Miller died in 1815, a comparatively
poor man, having exhausted his fortune by
improvements and experiments. It has been stated by his
son that he spent fully £30,000 in projects of a purely public
nature. Taylor died in 1824, in straitened circumstances,
leaving a widow and daughters, to whom the Government
granted a pension of £50 a year.”</p>

<p>“The experiments at Carron, in 1789, had been witnessed
by a young man named Henry Bell, a working mason originally,
as it appears, afterwards a humble kind of engineer in
Glasgow, and later an hotel proprietor at Helensburgh. Bell
never lost sight of the idea, and when Symington ceased experimenting
in 1803 he took up the project. At the same
time an ingenious American, named Fulton, comes into the
field. He, in company with Bell, visited the <span class="smcap">Charlotte
Dundas</span> in 1803, and Bell gave to Fulton drawings of the
machinery which he (Bell) had obtained, partly from Mr.
Miller and partly from Symington.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The United States of America has the honour of having
built the first passenger steam-boat in the world, and she
held the monopoly of the steamship passenger traffic for a
period of about two years. She owes this honourable position
in the commercial world to the energy and perseverance of
Robert Fulton, who in spite of ridicule and active opposition,
and want of capital, succeeded in building, in 1807, a paddle
steam-packet, which he named the <span class="smcap">Clermont</span>. Shortly after
her trial trip, she was advertised to run from New York to
Albany, and, as soon as she could be got ready, the <span class="smcap">Clermont</span>
sailed on her first voyage up the Hudson.</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter, written by an eyewitness
on that occasion, tells how the people along the river
were excited by the passage of the steam-boat on her voyage
from New York to Albany:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was in the early autumn of the year 1807 that a
knot of villagers was gathered on a high bluff, just
opposite Poughkeepsie, on the west bank of the Hudson,
attracted by the appearance of a strange-looking craft,
which was slowly making its way up the river. Some
imagined it to be a sea-monster, whilst others did not
hesitate to express their belief that it was a sign of the
approaching judgment. What seemed strange in the
vessel was the substitution of a lofty and strange black
smoke-pipe rising from the deck, instead of the gracefully
tapered masts that commonly stood on the vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
navigating the stream, and, in place of the spars and
rigging, the curious play of the working beam and
piston, and the slow turning and splashing of the huge
and naked paddle-wheels, met his astonished gaze. The
dense clouds of smoke, as they rose wave upon wave,
added still more to the wonder of the rustics.</p>

<p>“This strange-looking craft was the <span class="smcap">Clermont</span> on her
trial trip to Albany; and, of the little knot of villagers
above mentioned, the writer, then a boy in his eighth
year, with his parents, formed a part; and I well
remember the scene, one so well-fitted to impress a
lasting picture upon the mind of a child accustomed to
watch the vessels that passed up and down the river.</p>

<p>“On her return trip, the curiosity she excited was
scarcely less intense—the whole country talked of
nothing but the sea-monster, belching forth fire and
smoke. The fishermen became terrified and rowed
homeward, and they saw nothing but destruction devastating
their fishing grounds; whilst the wreaths of
black vapours, and rushing noise of the paddle-wheels,
foaming with the stirred up waters, produced great
excitement amongst the boatmen, until it was more
intelligent than before; for the character of that curious
boat, and the nature of the enterprise she was pioneering
had been ascertained.”</p>
</div>

<p>Several accidents occurred to the machinery of the
<span class="smcap">Clermont</span> during her first season, but none of them caused
any loss of life. There were, however, so many of these mishaps
that the incredulous were encouraged in the belief that
she was a failure. But the misfortunes of the boat were not
limited to accidents to machinery and other legitimate mishaps.
They included wilful attempts at her destruction on
the part of those who felt that their business was about to be
injured by this new system of navigation. Vessels ran foul of
her intentionally, and so determined were the sloop owners and
others to rid themselves of this dangerous competitor, that it
became necessary for the Legislature to interfere. But in
spite of all opposition, Fulton forced his way onward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
upwards. He replaced his first steamer by a second and larger
one, also named the <span class="smcap">Clermont</span>, and, as the passenger trade
developed, other steamers were added to the line.</p>

<p>American capitalists in different parts of the United States
followed his example. Steamers were built so rapidly to ply
on the American Atlantic Seaboard, and on the Mississippi
and other rivers, that in 1823 (that is sixteen years after the
first passenger steamer in the world was built) there were 300
steamers plying on American waters.</p>

<p>The St. Lawrence is the chief dividing line between the
United States and Canada. It forms the great summer highway
for the traffic of British North America. By it the commerce
of Europe is brought into the country, and on its bosom
is borne outwards the wealth of the forests and the surplus
agricultural produce of the Dominion.</p>

<p>On the Canadian side of this great river are situated the two
important cities of Quebec and Montreal. Two years (1809)
after the building of Fulton’s <span class="smcap">Clermont</span>, and three years
before the first European steamer began to ply on the
River Clyde, the steamboat <span class="smcap">Accommodation</span> ran on the
St. Lawrence, maintaining a passenger service between Quebec
and Montreal.</p>

<p>The following account of this vessel, and of her first voyage,
appeared in the “Quebec Mercury” of that date:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Saturday morning at eight o’clock arrived here
from Montreal, being her first trip, the steamboat
<span class="smcap">Accommodation</span>, with ten passengers. This is the first
vessel of the kind that ever appeared in this harbour.
She is continually crowded with visitants. She left
Montreal on Wednesday, at two o’clock, so that her
passage was sixty-six hours, thirty of which she was at
anchor. She arrived at Three Rivers in twenty-four
hours. She has at present berths for twenty passengers,
which next year will be considerably augmented. No
wind or tide can stop her. She has 75 feet keel, and 85
on deck. The price for a passage up is nine dollars, and
eight down—the vessel supplying provisions. The great
advantage attending a vessel so constructed is, that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
passage may be calculated on to a degree of certainty,
in point of time, which cannot be the case with any vessel
propelled by sails only. The steamboat receives her
impulse from an open double-spoked, perpendicular
wheel, on each side, without any circular band or rim.
To the end of each double spoke is fixed a square board,
which enters the water, and by the rotary motion of the
wheel, acts like a paddle. The wheels are put and kept
in motion by steam, operating within the vessel. A
mast is to be fixed in her for the purpose of using a sail
when the wind is favourable, which will occasionally
accelerate her headway.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1813 two new steamers were placed on the St. Lawrence,
called respectively the <span class="smcap">Swiftsure</span> and the <span class="smcap">Car of Commerce</span>,
and, after a further interval of four years, a fourth steamer,
the <span class="smcap">Quebec</span>, began to ply between Quebec and Montreal.</p>

<p>The first of these steamers, the <span class="smcap">Swiftsure</span>, was 140 feet over
all, with a beam of 24 feet. On her maiden voyage she made
the passage from Montreal to Quebec in twenty-two and a half
hours, in the face of a strong easterly wind all the way.
Notwithstanding that she “beat the most famous of the sailing
packets on the line (fourteen hours in a race of thirty-six
hours), her owners do not seem to have been very confident
of her movements under all circumstances, or of the number
of passengers who would patronise her, for she was advertised
to sail ‘as the wind and passengers may suit.’”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">Without, in the slightest degree, detracting from the credit
due to the inventors referred to in the earlier pages of this
history, it is indisputable that the River Clyde is the birthplace
of European Steam Navigation.</p>

<p>For many years the <span class="smcap">Charlotte Dundas</span> (a success from an
engineering point of view, but a failure commercially), lay idle
and corroding at Lock 16 on the Forth and Clyde Canal. She
was regarded by the majority of those who saw her there, as a
monument of Symington’s folly—the embodiment of a “fad.”</p>

<p>Bell, however, throughout these years, retained his faith in
the ultimate success of the Marine Steam Engine. There seemed
to be no probability of steam being utilized as a motive power
for vessels in British waters, but the Americans were more
enterprising, and Fulton, who accompanied Bell to inspect the
<span class="smcap">Charlotte Dundas</span> in 1803, gave the latter to understand that
he had influential friends in America, whom he could induce
to build steamers. Bell had good reason to consider himself
badly treated by Fulton in this matter, yet, undoubtedly,
indirectly Bell was benefited by Fulton’s success. It is more
than probable that during the five years that succeeded the
building of the <span class="smcap">Clermont</span>, frequent reports regarding both
this vessel and her successors in the United States and Canada,
reached Scotland. And as a consequence of the success of
these boats, Bell succeeded in getting a small steamer built to
trade on the River Clyde. The following is a copy of Mr.
Bell’s advertisement of the sailing of his steamer:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Comet</span>, between Glasgow, Greenock and Helensburgh,
for passengers only. The subscriber having at
much expense, fitted up a handsome vessel to ply upon
the River Clyde, between Glasgow and Greenock, to sail
by the power of wind, air, and steam, he intends that the
vessel shall leave the Bromielaw on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays, about mid-day or such hour thereafter as
may answer from the state of the tide; and to leave
Greenock on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, in the
morning to suit the tide. The terms are fixed for the
present at 4s. for the best cabin, and 3s. for the second;
but beyond these rates nothing is to be allowed to servants
or any other person employed about the vessel.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Comet</span> was a steamer of 25 tons burden, 40 feet long,
and 10 feet 6 inches broad, and she steamed about 5 miles per
hour.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the “Steamship” (1st January, 1883),
relates regarding one Dougal Jamson, a Clyde skipper, of the
time of the <span class="smcap">Comet</span>, that whenever the steamboat passed his slow
going sloop, he invariably piped all hands—a man and a boy—and
bade them “Kneel down and thank God, that ye sail wi’
the Almichty’s ain win’, an’ no’ wi’ the deevil’s sunfire an’
brimstane, like that spluttery thing there.”</p>

<p>The following year there were three additional steamers constantly
plying on the Clyde between Glasgow and Greenock.
One of these was probably the steamer (whose name has not
been recorded), which came from the Clyde to Liverpool in
1815. The second of this trio was the <span class="smcap">Industry</span>, whose
remains were to be seen more than half a century later at
Bowling. And the third was the steamer <span class="smcap">Argyle</span>, afterwards
re-named the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>.</p>

<p>All these boats were faster than the <span class="smcap">Comet</span>, and were
twice as large, being 75 feet long and 14 feet broad. Against
such competitors the <span class="smcap">Comet</span> could not compete successfully.
In his later years Bell received a small annuity from the Clyde
Trustees, who, after his decease, erected an obelisk to his
memory, which may still be seen standing on a rock a little
below Bowling.</p>

<p>For two or three summers Glasgow was the only City in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Great Britain or Ireland whose citizens enjoyed the advantages
of steam packet communication with the coast. But, in the
summer of the year 1815, the citizens of London and of Cork
were given equal facilities.</p>

<p>Ireland has always occupied a most honourable position in
the Annals of Steam Navigation. Cork had a steamship
service certainly as early as Liverpool; the pioneer of the
Liverpool coasting steamship trade was a Belfast steamer; from
Cork, sailed the first steamer with passengers from Europe to
America; the first Trans-Atlantic Liner from Liverpool was
a Dublin steamer; and in this year of grace 1903, the steamers
built in Belfast, which carry the White Star flag across the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, have a reputation unsurpassed by
any steamships afloat. But Cork anticipated Belfast in shipbuilding
and ship-owning. Messrs. Michael O’Brien and
Christopher Owens, of Cork, were the first to introduce steamers
to the merchants and travelling public of the South of Ireland.
They built, in 1815, the river steamer <span class="smcap">City of Cork</span>. She
was a wooden paddle steamer of 50 tons register; and of
slightly larger dimensions than the Clyde-built steamers
referred to, being 86 feet long, 13 feet broad, and 9 feet deep.</p>

<p>The steam fleet of the Thames consisted at this date of the
three steam-packets <span class="smcap">Marjory</span>, <span class="smcap">Defiance</span> and <span class="smcap">Thames</span>, which
steamers plied between London and Margate. The <span class="smcap">Defiance</span>,
probably a locally built vessel, was commanded by William
Robins, and sailed from near Summer Quay, Billingsgate,
every Sunday and Wednesday morning, at 7 o’clock, returning
from Margate every Tuesday and Friday morning.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Thames</span>, steam yacht,” (says the London “Times,” of
the 8th July, 1815), “from London to Margate, starts from
Wool Quay, near the Custom House, Thames Street, every
Tuesday and Saturday at 8 o’clock a.m., precisely, and leaves
Margate on her return to London every Monday and Thursday
at the same hour. This rapid, capacious and splendid vessel
lately accomplished a voyage of 1,500 miles, has twice crossed
St. George’s Channel, and came round the Land’s End with a
rapidity unknown before in naval history, and is the first steam
vessel that ever traversed those seas. She has the peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
advantage of proceeding either by sails or steam, separated or
united, by which means the public have the pleasing certainty
of never being detained on the water after dark, much less one
or two nights, which has frequently occurred with the old
packets. Against the wind, the tide, or in the most perfect
calm, the passage is alike certain, and has always been achieved
in one day. Her cabins are spacious, and are fitted up with all
that elegance could suggest, or personal comfort require; presenting
a choice library, backgammon boards, draught tables,
and other means of amusement. For the express purpose of
combining delicacy with comfort a female servant attends upon
the ladies. The fares (which include Pier Duty) are in the
Chief Cabin 15s., and in the Fore Cabin 11s., children half
price. No articles or goods will be taken, except the luggage
accompanying passengers; and the proprietors will not be
answerable for any of the above, unless delivered into the care
of the Steward, nor to the amount of more than £5 value,
except entered and paid for as such.”</p>

the Clyde to the Thames, referred to in the above quotation

<p class="center">“The Year 1815.”</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">To the student of British history, the year 1815 is one of the
most remarkable of the nineteenth century. In June of that
year was fought the Battle of Waterloo—a victory for the
British which effectually destroyed the power of the first
Napoleon, and delivered Europe from the terror of a military
despotism. The merchants of the “good old town” of Liverpool
were determined that the famous victory should never be
forgotten by their descendants, and so they perpetuated the
name in the “Waterloo Road,” the “Waterloo Dock,” and
their latest seaside suburb “Waterloo.” Another event
occurred in that same eventful month of June, 1815, an event
unheralded at the time, but whose results have been more
widely spread and more beneficent than those which resulted
from the Battle of Waterloo. This was the arrival from the
Clyde of the first steamer ever seen on the river Mersey. The
following brief and unsatisfactory paragraph appeared in the
“Liverpool Mercury” of the 30th June:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Liverpool Steamboat.—On Wednesday last, about
noon, the public curiosity was considerably excited by
the arrival of the first steamboat ever seen in our river.
She came from the Clyde, and in her passage called at
Ramsay, in the Isle of Man, which place she left early
on the same morning. We believe she is intended to
ply between this port and Runcorn, or even occasionally
as far as Warrington. Her cabin will contain about
one hundred passengers.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is one of the most tantalising paragraphs ever printed.
If “the public curiosity was considerably excited,” the reporter
certainly took no pains to gratify it. The name of the vessel is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
not given, nor any particulars of her dimensions, or of her
power and speed. The daring mariners who navigated her are
nameless, and the incidents of this pioneer voyage are left
unrecorded.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Fortunately we are able, from other sources, to gather some idea
of the size and appearance of the vessel, and of the impression
she made on the minds of the spectators. She was presumably
one of the three steamers built on the Clyde in 1813, as competitors
against the <span class="smcap">Comet</span>, for passengers between Glasgow
and Greenock; the other two were the <span class="smcap">Argyle</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Industry</span>. There was only a difference of five feet between
the smallest and the largest of these three steamers, so that a
description of the <span class="smcap">Argyle</span> will answer for the others as well.
The <span class="smcap">Argyle</span> was a packet steamer of 70 tons register, measuring
in her keel 79 feet, with 16 feet beam, paddle wheels 9 feet in
diameter, and engines 14 h.p. Her smoke was carried off by a
funnel, which also did duty as a mast, being rigged with a large
square sail. A gallery, upon which the cabin windows opened,
projected so as to form a continuous deck, interrupted only by
the paddle boxes, an arrangement which had the further effect
of making the vessel appear larger than she really was. On the
outside of the gallery eighteen large port holes were painted,
which, with the two she displayed upon her stern, made the
<span class="smcap">Argyle</span> look so formidable to those to whom a steamer was a
novelty, that it was stated in a Committee of the House of
Commons, by several naval officers, that if they had met her at
sea they would have endeavoured to reconnoitre before
attempting to bring her to. After plying for twelve months
between Glasgow and Greenock, the <span class="smcap">Argyle</span> was sold to a
London firm, who changed her name to the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>. In consequence
of this change of ownership, this vessel made one of the
most remarkable voyages ever accomplished by any steamer.
An interesting narrative of the voyage, from which these particulars
are taken, was published in “Chambers’ Journal” on
the 25th April, 1857.</p>

<p>The task of bringing the little steam-packet round by sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
from the Clyde to the Thames, was intrusted to an ex-naval
officer named Dodd, a man of considerable and diverse abilities.
He projected the Thames tunnel, proposing to carry it across
from Gravesend to Tilbury, at an estimated cost of under
£16,000. According to an account of the voyage which Dodd
himself published in the “Morning Chronicle” of the 15th
June, 1815, and afterwards embodied in his evidence before a
Committee of the House of Commons, Dodd sailed from
Glasgow about the middle of May with a crew of eight persons—a
mate, an engineer, a stoker, four seamen, and a cabin-boy.
His voyage at first was far from auspicious. The weather was
stormy, the sea ran high in the strait which separates Scotland
from Ireland, and either through ignorance or negligence, the
pilot during the night altered the course of the vessel, so that
it ran a great risk of being wrecked. Dodd had given orders
that the steamer should be steered so as to gain the Irish coast
by the morning; but at break of day a heavy gale was blowing,
and it was discovered that, instead of being off the coast of
Ireland, they were within half-a-league off a lee shore, rock
bound, about two miles to the north of Port Patrick. Relying
entirely upon the efficiency of his engine, Dodd at once laid the
vessel’s head directly to windward, and ordered the log to be
kept constantly going. The plan succeeded. The <span class="smcap">Thames</span>
began slowly to clear the shore, going direct in the wind’s eye
at the rate of something more than three knots an hour. On
the 24th of May the voyagers arrived safely at Dublin, where
they were joined by a Mr. Weld and his wife. Mrs. Weld has
the proud distinction of having been the first lady passenger to
cross the St. George’s Channel on a steamboat. Mr. Weld kept
a journal, from which the following is an extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>“On the 25th May, 1815, I heard by accident that a
steam-vessel had arrived at Dublin. I immediately
went to see her, and found her on the point of starting
with a number of curious visitors upon an experimental
trip in the bay. I was so much pleased with all that I
saw and heard concerning her, that, having previously
intended to proceed to London, I determined to request<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Captain Dodd to receive me as a passenger, and to be
permitted to accompany him throughout the voyage.
He at once consented, and my wife having resolved on
sharing the dangers of the voyage with me, we proceeded
to make the necessary arrangements for our
departure. On the 28th of May, being Sunday, we left
the Liffey at noon. Many persons embarked with us
from curiosity, but only to cross the bay as far as
Dunleary (now Kingstown), where they landed.
Unfortunately, the sea was very rough, which
occasioned the most violent sea-sickness amongst the
passengers. Several naval officers were on board, who
were unanimous in declaring it to be their firm opinion
that the vessel could not live long in heavy seas, and
that there would be much danger in venturing far
from shore. I deemed it right to inform my wife of this
opinion, but, although she suffered greatly from sea-sickness,
she persisted in her intention of accompanying
me, and that evening, after having passed some hours
on land at the house of a friend, the vessel put to sea,
we being the only passengers. The shore was covered
with several thousands of spectators, who cheered and
wished us a prosperous voyage.</p>

<p>“The sea was comparatively calm as the vessel steamed
into the Bay of Dalkey, and the passengers calculated
on a pleasant voyage during the night, but, when
beyond the shelter of the coast, they found it to be as
rough as ever. The <span class="smcap">Thames</span> again proved her admirable
sea-going qualities, bounding so lightly over the
waves that her passengers were not once wetted, even by
the spray.”</p>
</div>

<p>She soon left behind her all the vessels which had sailed from
Dublin with the same tide, and about nine o’clock next morning
arrived off Wexford. The dense smoke which issued from its
mast chimney being observed from the heights above the town,
it was concluded that the vessel was on fire. All the pilots
immediately put off to its assistance; and nothing could exceed
their surprise, mingled with disappointment, when they saw
that the ship was in no danger whatever, and that their hopes
of salvage were at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The weather had now become so stormy, that Captain Dodd
determined to put into port, his great object being to navigate
the vessel safely to London, rather than, by using great
dispatch, to expose her to unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>At two o’clock on Tuesday morning, 30th May, Dodd left
Wexford and sailed for St. David’s Head, the most westerly
point of Wales. During the passage across St. George’s
Channel one of the blades of the starboard paddle wheel got
out of order. The engine was stopped and the blade cut away.
Some hours after a similar accident befell the port wheel, which
was remedied in the same manner. The loss of one blade in
each wheel made no apparent difference in the speed of the
vessel. Fortunately when the accidents occurred the sea was
very calm. After a voyage of twelve hours duration, the
steamer arrived at the Pass of Ramsay, between the island of
that name and St. David’s Head. There the adventurers
remained for three hours to oil the engine, and to give the
stoker, who had not quitted his post for an instant since leaving
Wexford, a little rest. There, too, as at Wexford, boats put
out from different parts of the coast to the assistance of the
vessel, which they believed to be on fire. Leaving Ramsay, the
<span class="smcap">Thames</span> steamed through the straits and across St. Bride’s Bay.
The weather had again become unfavourable, and a heavy sea
had arisen in the bay. So high indeed were the waves, that,
when ingulphed between them, the coast, though lofty, could
not be seen; but the little craft held her way most gallantly
over all.</p>

<p>On the south side of St. Bride’s Bay, between Skomar Island
and the mainland, there is a dangerous passage called Jack
Sound. The pilot warned the captain against attempting this
passage, except under favourable conditions as to wind and
water, but Dodd, who knew the power of his engine, insisted
on going through the sound, in order to save five hours, and to
avoid another night at sea. The dangerous sound was safely
navigated, and the voyagers reached Milford Haven. As they
were steaming up the harbour, they met the Government mail
packet proceeding from Milford to Waterford, with all her sails
spread. They had passed her about a quarter of a mile, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Captain Dodd determined to send some letters by her to Ireland.
The <span class="smcap">Thames</span> was immediately put about, and in a few
minutes she was alongside the packet ship, and sailed round
her, although the latter continued under way. The captain and
passengers wrote a few letters, put them on board the packet,
sailed round her once more, and then continued their course to
Milford.</p>

<p>The two following days were spent in satisfying the curiosity
of numerous naval officers who were anxious to see the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>,
and to examine her engine, as well as to test her sailing powers.
It became necessary also to clean out the boiler, which had not
been done since leaving Glasgow. Late on the evening of the
31st May, she sailed in company with the <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span>, sloop-of-war,
whose captain (Bingham) and a company of ladies were aboard
the steamer, anxious to see how she would behave in a rough
sea. The <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span> was obliged to hoist royals and studding
sails to keep up with the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>, and at last by crowding all
sail, she got a little ahead. But the great superiority of steam
was yet to be shown. Dodd gallantly determined to carry the
ladies back to Milford, instead of transferring them to the
<span class="smcap">Myrtle</span> in an open boat. Accordingly he steamed back to
Milford, leaving the sloop of war far behind, and when he was
again outward bound, he found the sloop had anchored, being
unable owing to the failure of the wind to regain her former
station. Next morning (Friday) the voyagers found themselves
mid-way across the Bristol Channel, with no land
visible on either side, but towards evening the Cornish coast
was sighted. The weather, however, had again become
threatening, and the pilot did not consider it would be prudent
to attempt to round the Land’s End that night, and Dodd
accordingly decided to put into St. Ives. As the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>
approached the shore, a fleet of small craft was seen making
towards her, with all possible speed by means of sails and oars,
in the belief (as at Wexford) that the <span class="smcap">Thames</span> was a ship on
fire making for the port. When they discovered their mistake
they tacked about and endeavoured to out-sail each other. All
the rocks from which a view of St. Ives could be obtained were
crowded with spectators, to whom the appearance of the <span class="smcap">Thames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></span>
created as much surprise as the ships of Captain Cook produced
amongst the islanders of the South Sea. The harbour of St.
Ives affording no shelter from gales from the North East, Dodd
took his vessel to the sheltered port of Hayle, four miles distant,
where she lay in perfect safety. It had been represented to
Mr. and Mrs. Weld that rounding the Land’s End was the most
difficult and dangerous part of the voyage, and they had in
consequence crossed the neck of land to the South coast with
the intention of remaining there until the steamer arrived.
On further consideration, however, they resolved, instead of
waiting for the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>, to return to Hayle, and to brave with
the steamer’s crew the dangers of doubling the Land’s End.
The weather having moderated they re-embarked at 4 o’clock
on Monday afternoon, 5th June, and the steamer at once
proceeded on her voyage.</p>

<p>As the little vessel rounded Cornwall Head, the more
northerly of the two great promontories which terminate
England on the west, a tremendous swell from the Atlantic met
her, whilst the tide, which ran strongly down St. George’s
Channel, combining with the swell, raised the waves to such a
height as to render her position in the highest degree alarming.
Dodd would not put back, and after a night of severe struggle,
the adventurers succeeded in rounding the Land’s End, and
found themselves in a comparatively tranquil sea. Next day
the sun shone with great brilliance, and revealed the beauties
of the South Coast as they steamed along it towards Plymouth,
which they reached at eleven o’clock in the morning. As the
<span class="smcap">Thames</span> passed the various ships at anchor, the sailors on board
ran in crowds to the sides of their vessels or climbed the rigging
for a better view. The harbour-master, who had never seen a
steam vessel before, was as much excited when he boarded the
<span class="smcap">Thames</span> as a child is in getting possession of a new plaything.</p>

<p>The whole of the following day (Wednesday) was occupied
in showing the capabilities of the steamer to the Port-Admiral
and to the naval officers who went on board.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thames</span> left Plymouth at noon on Thursday for Portsmouth,
where she arrived at 11 o’clock on Friday morning,
having steamed 155 miles in twenty-three hours. At Portsmouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
she created a greater sensation than at any of the ports
she had visited. Tens of thousands of spectators assembled
to gaze at her; and the number of vessels that crowded around
her was so great, that it became necessary to request the Port-Admiral
to assign the voyagers a guard, in order to preserve
some degree of order. The <span class="smcap">Thames</span> steamed into the harbour
in the most brilliant style, travelling with the aid of wind and
tide at the rate of between twelve and fourteen knots an hour.
A court-martial was sitting at the time on board the <span class="smcap">Gladiator</span>
frigate, but the novelty of the steam-boat presented an irresistible
attraction, and the whole court went off to her (except the
president). At an early hour next morning (Saturday), the
Port-Admiral, Sir Edward Thornborough, sent his band and a
guard of marines on board, and soon afterwards followed in
person, accompanied by three admirals, eighteen post-captains,
and a large number of ladies. The morning was spent very
pleasantly in steaming amongst the fleet, and running over to
the Isle of Wight. The Admiral, and all the naval officers,
expressed themselves delighted with the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>.</p>

<p>From Portsmouth the steamer proceeded to Margate, which
was reached on Sunday morning. She remained at Margate
until the following day, when she started on the final portion
of her voyage at half-past eight in the morning, and reached
her destination (Limehouse), about six o’clock the same evening,
having accomplished the ninety miles run from Margate in
about nine hours. The <span class="smcap">Thames</span> carried fifteen tons of coal,
her consumption being, on the average, a ton for every hundred
miles. So ended this memorable voyage, practically the first
ever attempted by a steamboat on the open sea.</p>

<p>Dodd’s after career was a most melancholy one. Talented,
enterprising and courageous though he undoubtedly was, yet
he never succeeded in his enterprises. And in his later years,
instead of seeking that divine help which would have enabled
him to meet his disappointments with fortitude, he sought to
forget them in intemperance, and almost literally died a beggar
in the streets.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The successful voyage from the Clyde to the Thames achieved
by Captain Dodd, and the less-known one by the Runcorn
Packet from the Clyde to the Mersey, gave a great impetus
to steam-packet building, and created active opposition,
especially on the London and Margate service. The <span class="smcap">Thames</span>,
after being refitted, opened the service in July, 1815. She had
a monopoly of the station for about three months, when the
<span class="smcap">Defiance</span> was put on in opposition. The following year saw
the <span class="smcap">Majestic</span> placed on the River Thames, and this vessel was
probably the first steamer employed in towing ships. She
towed, on Wednesday, 28th August, 1816, the large Indiaman,
the <span class="smcap">Hope</span>, from Deptford to Woolwich at the rate of three
miles per hour against the wind.</p>

<p>On the 29th June of the same year, a new steamboat, named
the <span class="smcap">Regent</span>, was tried on the Thames. She was built under
the supervision of the eminent engineer Brunel, by Maudsley
(founder of the famous engineering firm of Maudsley and
Field). Her burden was 112 tons, and she was propelled by
engines of 24 horse power. On her trial trip she steamed from
Blackfriars Bridge to Battersea Bridge in 30 minutes, and
back through London Bridge in 52 minutes. Her machinery
was remarkably light. Her engines, paddle-wheels, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
connections necessary to give and convey the motive power,
weighing only five tons. The <span class="smcap">Regent</span> had a very short
existence. On the 2nd July, 1817, she left London for Margate,
with between 40 and 50 passengers on board. Although
it was blowing a gale, all went well until the vessel arrived off
Whitstable, about 18 miles from Margate. The <span class="smcap">Regent</span> was
keeping well out in mid-channel, and was about three miles
from land, when she was discovered to be on fire amidships.
The force of the wind had carried away the funnel, and the
wood-work at the bottom of the funnel (nearly breast high from
the deck for the protection of the passengers), caught fire. The
vessel’s life-saving equipment consisted of one small boat,
barely sufficient to accommodate her crew; and the only
available means of extinguishing the fire was by hand buckets,
dipped overside. To add to the alarm of the passengers, the
buckets one after the other were either broken against the side
of the steamer, or carried away by the turbulent waves. The
passengers bore themselves bravely, as Britons should in the
face of danger, and did not give way to panic. Perfect discipline
appears to have been maintained amongst the crew.
Seeing that he had no means of keeping the fire under, the
Captain collected all the passengers forward and headed the
<span class="smcap">Regent</span> for the nearest shore with the intention of beaching
her. This he succeeded in doing without the loss of a single
life, but the vessel herself was almost totally destroyed.</p>

<p>On the Mersey, also, progress had been made since the arrival
of the first steamer, the <span class="smcap">Packet</span>, to and from Runcorn.</p>

<p>In July, 1816, the steam-packet <span class="smcap">Princess Charlotte</span> commenced
the Liverpool and Eastham service, and continued to
sail twice each way daily. The fare charged to Eastham and
back was 1s. At Eastham the steamer connected with coaches
to and from Chester, Shrewsbury, Holyhead, and many other
places.</p>

<p>The Liverpool and Tranmere Steam Ferry was opened by the
steam-packet “Etna” sailing from the West-side Queen’s
Dock. She was shortly afterwards opposed by the steam-packet
<span class="smcap">Regulator</span>, running in connection with coaches from
Tranmere to Parkgate, thence by steam-packet <span class="smcap">Ancient Briton</span>
to Bagillt, North Wales. During a gale on Monday, 12th
January, 1818, the <span class="smcap">Regulator</span> was sunk near the Liverpool
Pierhead, but all on board were rescued.</p>

<p>Meantime other continental nations were awakening to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
advantages of steam navigation.</p>

<p>On the 30th May, 1817, there was launched at Seville the
<span class="smcap">Royal Ferdinand</span>, the first steamer built in Spain. And,
about the same date, Mr. Wesewelodsky, a man of great wealth,
and owner of several rich mines in Siberia, built two steamers
for navigating the River Kama. These vessels were 51 feet
and 100 feet long, respectively. Mr. Wesewelodsky travelled
with his steamers from his mines to Casan, a distance of 1,000
versts, and accomplished the voyage in 105 hours.</p>

<p><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>“England owes to David Napier the establishment of
deep-sea communication by steam-vessels, and of Post Office
steam-packets. As a first step, he endeavoured to ascertain
the difficulties to be encountered. For this purpose he took
passage at a stormy period of the year on a sailing packet,
which formed one of a line, and the only means of intercourse
between Glasgow and Belfast; a passage which often
required seven days to accomplish what is now done by steam
in as many hours. The captain of the packet found a young
man, whom he afterwards knew as Mr. Napier, during one of
his winter passages to Belfast, constantly perched on the bow
of the vessel, fixing an intent gaze on the sea when it broke
on the side of the ship, quite heedless of the waves and spray
that washed over him. He only ceased from this occupation
at intervals, as the breeze freshened, to ask the captain
whether the sea was such that it might be considered a rough
one, and, when told that it was by no means unusually rough,
he returned to the bow of the vessel and resumed his study
of the waves breaking at her stem. When the breeze began
to freshen into a gale, and the sea to rise considerably, he
again enquired of the captain whether the sea might now be
considered a rough one, and was told that as yet it could not
be called very rough. Disappointed, he returned again to
his station at the bow, and resumed his employment. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
last he was favoured with a storm to his contentment, and
when the seas, breaking over the vessel, swept her from stem
to stern, he found his way back to the captain and repeated
his enquiry, ‘Do you call it rough now?’ The captain
replied he could not remember having faced a worse night
in the whole of his experience, a reply which delighted
young Napier, who muttering, as he turned away, ‘I think
I can manage if that is all,’ went down to his cabin. Napier
saw then the end of his difficulties, and soon satisfied himself
as to the means of overcoming them. His next enquiry was
as to the means of getting through the water with least
resistance. To determine this, he commenced a series of
experiments with models of vessels in a small tank of water,
and soon found that the round full bluff bow adopted for
sailing vessels was quite unsuited for speed with mechanical
propulsion of a different nature. This led him to adopt the
fine wedge-like bows by which the vessels built under his
superintendence were afterwards so distinguished.”</p>
</div>

<p>Napier established regular steam-packet communication
between Greenock and Belfast by means of the <span class="smcap">Rob Roy</span>, a
vessel of 90 tons burden and 30 horse power. After plying
for two years between these ports with great regularity and
success, the <span class="smcap">Rob Roy</span> was transferred to the English Channel
as a packet between Dover and Calais. Cross-channel steamboats
between England and Ireland were first introduced in
1816, when the steam-packet <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span> was built by a company
to carry passengers between Holyhead and Howth. The
<span class="smcap">Hibernia</span> was 112 tons burden, 77 feet keel measurement, and
9 feet draft. She was lugger rigged, and capable of making
the passage by sails only. Her average passage, Holyhead to
Howth, was about seven hours, and her passengers frequently
had the satisfaction of arriving in Dublin considerably in
advance of the Mail packets.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Many circumstances combined to make the Clyde the birthplace
and the home of the Marine Steam Engine. Coal and
iron mines were in close proximity, and skilled labour for the
construction of engines and of ships was abundant. The
beautiful Firth, with its numerous lochs and islands, constituted
an ideal locality for the employment of steamboats while yet
the art of steamship building was in its infancy. And on the
shores of the River, or within easy distance of it, dwelt a large
industrial population, eager to take advantage of the facilities
for travel which steamboats afforded.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is not surprising that steam-packets
on the Clyde increased with marvellous rapidity. In
1812 the <span class="smcap">Comet</span> first began to ply between Glasgow, Greenock
and Helensburgh, and she was, in fact, the only steamboat then
sailing on British waters. Three years later (in 1815) a fleet
of seven steamers, viz., the <span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>, <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, <span class="smcap">Dumbarton
Castle</span>, <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span>, <span class="smcap">Argyle</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince of Orange</span>, and <span class="smcap">Princess
Charlotte</span>, sailed regularly from Glasgow to Largs, Ardrossan,
Troon and Ayr, southwards; and Rothesay, Tarbert, Lochgilphead
and Inverary, westwards. No agents’ names are given in
any of the press advertisements of this or previous years, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>the sailings were advertised on boards placed outside the
agent’s counting houses, and exhibited in taverns and other
places of public resort. In 1816 and subsequent years the
owners’ or agents’ names are appended to the press notices of
the various steam-packets.</p>

<br>

<p>In May of the year named, the steamboats <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> and
(new) <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span> were advertised to sail between Glasgow and
all the watering places on both sides of the Clyde.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Families wishing to agree for the season may know
particulars by applying to Mr. Lewis MacLellan, Gallowgate,
Mr. Wm. Smith, Bromielaw, and the Masters on
board.”</p>
</div>

<p>These small steamers were the pioneers of the magnificent
fleet of Channel steamships, sailing from Glasgow, and known
as the “Laird Line.” A grandson of the Mr. Lewis MacLellan
here referred to, and a nephew, are still (1903) connected with
the Company as directors. The steamer <span class="smcap">Albion</span> was advertised in
the same paper in similar terms, and on the 9th July following
the agents of nine steam-packets sailing from Glasgow, gave
notice that the issue of season tickets was discontinued for the
remainder of the season.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that the issue of season contract tickets,
popularly supposed to be a modern institution of the railway
companies, is found to be a common practice amongst the
steamship owners of Glasgow more than three-quarters of a
century ago.</p>

<p>Mr. W. S. Lindsay, in his admirable book “The History of
Merchant Shipping from 1816 to 1874,” quotes Mr. Muirhead’s
“Life of Watt,” as stating that “In April, 1817, Mr. James
Watt, Jun., purchased the <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span>, and having re-fitted her,
took her in October to Holland and up the Rhine to Coblentz;
having thus been the first to cross the English Channel in a
steamboat. The average speed he obtained was seven and a
half knots an hour.”</p>

<p>Either Mr. Muirhead was in error in the dates given, or he
was wrong in assuming that the <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span> was the first
steamer to cross the English Channel. A correspondent of the
“Glasgow Chronicle,” in a letter to that Journal, dated Cologne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
16th June, 1816 (<em>i.e.</em>, sixteen months prior to the date mentioned
by Mr. Muirhead as the date on which the <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span> crossed
the Channel), says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To-day, about noon, we enjoyed a sight equally novel
and entertaining, a pretty large vessel without a mast
ascending the Rhine, and proceeding with astonishing
rapidity, arrive before this city. All the vessels
stationed on the Rhine in this neighbourhood were in
a moment covered with spectators, to see the arrival of
this vessel, which is a steamboat coming from London,
and bound for Frankfort. Everybody was eager to view
the progress, the motion, the organisation of this masterpiece
of art. The vessel left Rotterdam on the 6th
inst. The passengers affirm that it can go 25 leagues in
a day.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dumbarton Castle</span> (Captain Thomson) was advertised
to take passengers for a trip from Glasgow round Ailsa Craig
on the 7th August, 1816. She was the first British steamboat
(the <span class="smcap">Thames</span> excepted) to take passengers on a deep sea
trip, and she was also the first steamer to sail round the North
of Scotland, which she did in 1819, in consequence of being
sold for employment between Leith and Grangemouth.</p>

<p>The first serious accident to a Clyde steamboat of which
there is any record, occurred in the early part of the year 1816.
The new steam-packet <span class="smcap">Rothesay Castle</span>, while entering the
harbour of Tarbert on her return voyage from Inverary, struck
on a reef of sunken rocks. All her passengers were rescued by
fishing boats, which also landed the luggage. One of the
fishing boats was also despatched to request the Master of the
<span class="smcap">Argyle</span> (which was to leave Inverary four hours later than
the <span class="smcap">Rothesay Castle</span>) to call at Tarbert. This was accordingly
done and the shipwrecked passengers were taken on to
Rothesay and Greenock the same evening. The steamer was
subsequently got off the rocks and taken to Port Glasgow for
repairs.</p>

<p>It may interest citizens of Glasgow and dwellers on the
coast to compare, by means of the following table, the steamship
Passenger Fares of 1818 with those of the present day.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">Prior to the introduction of marine steam engines, the United
States of America had no inconsiderable share of the world’s
ocean traffic. No swifter ships raced with cargoes of tea
from China to the Thames than the famous Baltimore clippers.
No finer vessels crossed the Atlantic than the celebrated New
York Packet Liners. It cannot be supposed that a people so
enterprising as the Americans would make no attempt at
ocean steam navigation. On the contrary, as they were the
first to build a coasting passenger steamer, so were they the
first to build a steamer to cross the Atlantic.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the year 1818, and the beginning
of 1819, there was, in process of building at New York, a
beautiful little ship of about 320 tons burden. Whilst on the
stocks it was suggested to convert her into a steamer, which
was accordingly done. After she was launched, the <span class="smcap">Savannah</span>,
that being the name given to her, sailed from New York to
Savannah, and thence, about the 25th May, 1819, she sailed
to Liverpool, en route to St. Petersburg. It was reported at
the time that she was a present from the Americans to the
Emperor of Russia. Although she did not steam the whole of
the voyage from Savannah to Liverpool, which occupied twenty-six
days, she was the first steamer that ever attempted to cross
the Atlantic. British and Canadian authors have contended
that she was not entitled to this honour, as her steam power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
was merely auxiliary, but the contention is somewhat ungenerous,
and, if allowed, would debar later vessels, notably
the <span class="smcap">Sarah Sands</span> and the <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>, from claiming the
title of steamships. The <span class="smcap">Savannah</span> reached Liverpool on
Sunday, 20th June, 1819, after a voyage of twenty-six days
duration. Shortly after leaving Savannah it began to blow
hard, and the following entry appears in the Captain’s log
book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Stopped the engines, and brought the paddle-wheels<br>
in-board in thirty minutes.”</p>
</div>

<p>When off the Irish coast, the coastguard, seeing a huge
volume of smoke proceeding from a ship at sea, reported it to
be a vessel on fire. A Government cutter from Cork put out
to render assistance, and were much surprised on boarding her
to learn that she required no assistance, except a Channel pilot,
and that she had come from America. Her arrival at Liverpool
was witnessed by great crowds of people, who had
assembled to watch her entering the Mersey. After her visit
to St. Petersburg she re-crossed the Atlantic, her engines were
taken out of her, and, as a sailing packet, she traded between
New York and Savannah, until she was wrecked off Long
Island.</p>

<p>A month later, or to be exact, on the 22nd July, 1819, the
first cross-channel steamer that ever entered the port, arrived
at Liverpool from Belfast, after a passage of twenty-four hours.
This steamer was the <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, owned by Messrs. Langtry,
of Belfast, who were also the owners of a fleet of smacks which
traded regularly between the two ports. The <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span> was
a schooner-rigged paddle-steamer of 201 tons burthen, propelled
by a pair of low-pressure engines of 80 h.p. each. Her
length was 98 feet, and her breadth on deck was 37 feet. She
had a dining room capable of accommodating all the cabin
passengers at one sitting, a separate and neatly decorated cabin
for ladies, and two staterooms for families. She carried
sleeping accommodation for 22 cabin passengers, in addition
to steerage passengers. The fares charged for a single passage
between Liverpool and Belfast were, cabin £1 11s. 6d., steerage
10s. 6d. The <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span> made two round voyages per week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
during the season, sailing from Liverpool every Monday and
Friday. She was intended to carry passengers only (the cargo
trade being maintained by the smacks), and cost her owners
nearly £10,000.</p>

<p>On the 29th July of the same year, the first steamer that
traded between Liverpool and Glasgow was advertised in the
following terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center no-indent">
“Safe and Expeditious Travelling between Liverpool<br>
and Glasgow.<br>
The elegant new Steam-Packet Boat,<br>
<span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>,<br>
Captain John Patterson,</p>
<p class="no-indent">will sail for Glasgow on Monday, 2nd August, at Seven
o’clock in the morning, from George’s Dock, Pierhead.
The accommodations for passengers are most excellent,
and she is expected to perform the passage within 30
hours.</p>
<p>“The Fares in the Cabin, 40s.; Steerage, 21s. Passengers
will be accommodated with Provisions on
moderate terms. For passage apply to Captain
Patterson, or to</p>

<p class="right">John Richardson.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this date (1819) the expansion of the British steam
coasting trade was most rapid. Within a very short time
regular services were advertised between Liverpool and Isle
of Man, Whitehaven, Dumfries, the Clyde Ports, Belfast and
Dublin. Nor were these pioneers of the steam trade permitted
to be monopolists of their respective stations. Frequently
two, and in some cases three companies advertised
steamers sailing for the same ports, of which some account will
be found in the succeeding chapters of this volume.</p>

<p>An extraordinary accident is reported by the “Berwick
Advertiser” (September, 1819), as having occurred to one of
the local steam-packets. The <span class="smcap">Morning Star</span>, while on her
usual passage from Alloa to Leith, suddenly stopped. On
investigation it was discovered that a salmon had entered and
completely obstructed the condensing water pipes, and thus
stopped the machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>In the fall of the following year (1820) steam communication
between the Ports of London and Hull was projected.</p>

<p>Across the Channel the steam-packet <span class="smcap">Triton</span>, built at
Bordeaux, maintained a passenger service, three times each
way per week, between Havre and Rouen. The passage
occupied about nine hours, and the fares charged were 8s. first
class, and 4s. second class.</p>

<p>On the 5th October, 1820, the steamer <span class="smcap">Conde De Patmella</span>,
Captain Silva, sailed from Liverpool for the Brazils. She
made a remarkably rapid passage to Lisbon, arriving there in
four days. This is probably the first steamer that ever crossed
the Atlantic Ocean from Europe.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most remarkable steamers ever launched
was a small steamboat, named the <span class="smcap">Snake</span>, built at Bombay,
and launched in 1820. She was the first steamer on the Indus
or on any river in India. Her engines were designed and built
by a Parsee, and were the first ever manufactured in India.
How well they were constructed is evidenced by their lasting
power. After a notable career of 60 years, she was broken up
in 1880.</p>

<p>Above the initials “W. P.,” a correspondent of the “Liverpool
Mercury,” in a letter dated 25th October, 1820, suggests
the use of iron ventilators, to supply fresh air to the holds of
steamers carrying cattle across the Channel, for, of course, at
that date, steamers to carry cattle across the ocean were
unthought of. He describes the ventilators suggested as
“iron funnels with movable vane tops, which could be constructed
by any mechanic at a cost of about £3 10s. each.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1821, a new steamboat, named the <span class="smcap">Tourist</span>,
was launched at Perth. When launched she was the largest
steamer in the United Kingdom, being 128 feet long by 40 feet
broad. She was rigged as a three-masted schooner, with a
clipper bow and bowsprit, and was propelled by two engines of
40 h.p. each. She was intended (as her name implies) for the
passenger trade between Leith and the Northern Ports of
Scotland, and her owners claimed that communication between
the ports named “will thus be effected in one-third less time,
and for one-sixth of the expense incurred by the present mode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of travelling.” After running for a short time in the Leith
and North of Scotland trade, she was placed on the station
between Newhaven and London, on behalf of the London and
Edinburgh Steampacket Co.</p>

<p>In May of the same year two steam vessels of upwards of 400
tons burden each, were built for the Leith and London passenger
service. These steamers were not intended to carry
cargo, but they had sleeping accommodation for one hundred
passengers. They were propelled by engines of 100 h.p., and
were expected to make the passage in about sixty hours.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The year 1822, witnessed the first operations of what was
destined to become one of the most famous of the early Steam-Packet
Companies. Projected the previous year, the St.
George Steam-Packet Company immediately contracted with
Mr. Thomas Wilson, of Liverpool, for two large and powerful
steamers, the <span class="smcap">St. Patrick</span> and the <span class="smcap">St. George</span>. The former
was intended to trade between Dublin and Liverpool, and
Dublin and the Bristol Channel; and the latter between Liverpool,
the Isle of Man, and the River Clyde, Mr. Alex. A. Laird,
the founder of the well-known firm of Alex. A. Laird &amp; Co.,
being the agent at Greenock. The <span class="smcap">St. Patrick</span> was launched
at 10-30 a.m. on the 21st April, 1822. This event excited
great interest in the town of Liverpool, as she was, if not the
first steamer ever built in the port, certainly the finest specimen
of the ship-building craft produced there up to that date.
Her sister ship, the <span class="smcap">St. George</span>, launched the following day,
rapidly won for herself a reputation for comfort and speed.
After running about six months she made a voyage from
Dublin to Liverpool in 11½ hours, the shortest time on record.
Eighteen months later she made a passage from Liverpool to
Dublin in 10 hours 40 minutes, beating her previous record by
50 minutes. The third steamer was the <span class="smcap">Prince Llewellyn</span>,
to ply between Liverpool, Beaumaris, Bangor, and Carnarvon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>The St. George Steam-Packet Co. continued until 1844, when
it was re-constructed, the Cork Steamship Co. taking over its
various services and seven of its steamers.</p>
<br>

</figure>

<p>The steam-yacht <span class="smcap">Hero</span> is credited with a phenomenal speedy
voyage on the 26th July, 1822. She is reported to have
steamed from London to Margate in 6½ hours, being at the
rate of 14 miles an hour.</p>

<p>A report relative to steam navigation was laid before the
House of Commons (August, 1822). All the steam-packets
belonging to Liverpool were named in a manner highly
honourable to their owners, commanders and constructors.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Thursday, 9th May, 1822, a large party of
distinguished naval officers, engineers, &amp;c., embarked at
Parliament Stairs, London, on board the <span class="smcap">Aaron Manby</span>,
iron steamboat, which immediately got under weigh and
proceeded to Battersea Bridge; she then descended to
Blackfriars, and manœuvred for several hours between
the two bridges in a very superior style. This steamboat
was built at the Horsley Iron Works, near Birmingham,
by Mr. Manby, and put together at Rotherhithe. She is
the most complete specimen of workmanship in the iron
way that has ever been witnessed, and draws one foot less
water than any steamboat that has ever been built. She
is 106 feet long and 17 feet broad, and is propelled by a
30 h.p. engine and Oldham’s revolving bars. This boat
will leave London in a few days for Paris, the first
instance of a direct communication between the capitals
of France and England. Amongst the gentlemen
present were Admirals Sir William Hope, Sir Pulteny
Malcomb and Sir James Wood Gage; Captains Dundas
and Napier; Mr. Manby, the inventor; Mr. Williams,
the patentee of the revolving bars, &amp;c.”—“London
Courier,” 15th May, 1822.</p>
</div>

<p>On or about the 24th March, 1823, the steam-packet
<span class="smcap">Yorkshireman</span> arrived at Hull from Antwerp, and was only
31 hours on the passage. This vessel is noteworthy as being
the first steam vessel to sail from Hull to the Continent.</p>

<p>In the month of February of this year (1823) Mr. C. W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Williams, of Dublin, placed an order with Mr. Wilson, of
Liverpool, for the pioneer steamer of the future famous City of
Dublin Steam-Packet Company, the <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span>, a vessel
of 130 h.p. It was an express stipulation with the builder, that
this steamer should be constructed of such materials, and in such
a manner, as to withstand the severity of the winter navigation.
The <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span> differed from her competitors in two
respects, (1) in carrying general cargo in addition to live stock
and passengers, and (2) in maintaining the service uninterruptedly
throughout the twelve months.</p>

<p>A month later, Mr. Wilson was again applied to, to build a
second vessel for the company, but in consequence of his
having that very morning (5th March, 1823) contracted to build
the steam-packet <span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span> for the Liverpool and Glasgow
trade, it was not till some days later the contract was signed
for building the <span class="smcap">Town of Liverpool</span>, to be commenced as soon
as the <span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span> was launched.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span> sailed from Dublin on her maiden
voyage to Liverpool on Saturday, the 20th March, 1824. She
anticipated, by about six months, the operations of the Dublin
and Liverpool Steam Navigation Co., whose first steamer, the
<span class="smcap">Liffey</span>, 305 tons burthen, and 110 h.p., did not sail until the
13th September following. In December of the same year
(1824) the <span class="smcap">Mersey</span> joined the <span class="smcap">Liffey</span>, and in the July following
the <span class="smcap">Commerce</span> was added to the Navigation Co.’s fleet. The
<span class="smcap">Commerce</span> was considerably larger than either of her predecessors,
and was launched from the yard of Messrs. Grayson
and Leadley, Trentham Street, Liverpool.</p>

<p>Her (late) Majesty’s steamship <span class="smcap">Lightning</span> sailed from
Algiers for home on the 27th July, 1824, calling at Gibraltar
and Lisbon. She remained at Lisbon two days taking in coal,
and finally arrived at Plymouth nineteen days after leaving
Algiers. The <span class="smcap">Lightning</span> was one of the first vessels in the
British Navy to be supplied with steam power.</p>

<p>Two still existing and influential Steamship Companies were
established this year. The General Steam Navigation Co., of
London, and the Belfast Steam-Packet Co., afterwards merged
into the Belfast Steamship Co., Limited, of Belfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>The competition between the Steam-Packet Companies engaged
in the Scotch and North of Ireland passenger trade had
become so keen, that in the summer of 1825 the steamers from
Belfast to Glasgow lowered their fares to 2s. for 1st cabin, 6d.
for 2nd cabin, and carried deck passengers for nothing.</p>

<p>On the Dublin and Liverpool station competition was nearly
as severe, one steamer sailing in the autumn of 1825 with
upwards of 700 passengers carried at 6d. each.</p>

<p>Under these adverse circumstances, the proprietors of the
Dublin and Liverpool Steam Navigation Co. deemed it prudent
to make terms with their more powerful competitor, the City
of Dublin Steam-Packet Co. The managers of the latter
company, early in the following year (1st February, 1826),
purchased the Navigation Co.’s steamers, and increased the
capital of their own company to £250,000, in shares of £100
each.</p>

<p>The Press communications exchanged between the owners of
the rival steam-packets must have been extremely entertaining
to the citizens of Glasgow of that period. The following
extraordinary literary effusion, from the owners of the steamboat
<span class="smcap">Swift</span>, was published in the “Glasgow Herald,” of the
30th June, 1825:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The great superiority of the <span class="smcap">Swift</span> over the Cock Boat
that is puffed off as sailing direct from the Bromielaw
is now so well known at Glasgow and Belfast as scarcely
to require to be noticed in this advertisement, but for
the sake of strangers coming from a distance it may be
proper to state that her power and size are double, and
her speed so much greater, that when the two vessels
start together the <span class="smcap">Swift</span> runs the other out of sight in
five or six hours. Her hours of sailing are so adapted
to the tide, as to ensure the shortest possible passage, by
arriving at Greenock and Glasgow about high water, and
at Belfast as soon as there is water up to the quay.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following crushing reply of the owners of the steamer
referred to as “the Cock Boat,” appeared in the next issue of
the same newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fine new Steam-Packet <span class="smcap">George Canning</span> continues
to sail for Belfast every Tuesday and Friday. She is
the only Steam-Packet that sails direct from Glasgow,
therefore, her passengers are not subjected to the delay,
inconvenience and risk, attending change of vessel and
transhipment of luggage.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">George Canning</span> has crossed the Channel upwards
of 60 times, and has in every instance accomplished
her passage without putting into any intermediate ports.</p>

<p>“If the writer of a contemptible article in the <span class="smcap">Swift’s</span>
advertisement of Friday last, means the <span class="smcap">George
Canning</span>, he has the merit of stating a gross falsehood,
knowing it to be such; and, therefore, written for the
express purpose of deceiving the public!!!</p>

<p>“The author of the paragraph alluded to is challenged
to produce a single instance of the <span class="smcap">Swift</span> having ever
accomplished her passage from Belfast in so short a
period as the <span class="smcap">George Canning</span>.</p>

<p>“The public will be surprised to learn, after reading the
<span class="smcap">Swift’s</span> advertisement, particularly ‘strangers coming
from a distance,’ that the <span class="smcap">Swift</span> and the <span class="smcap">Canning</span> have
never yet sailed together either from Belfast or Glasgow;
therefore, the author of the <span class="smcap">Swift’s</span> advertisement is
left to state when and where the <span class="smcap">Swift</span> ran the vessel
alluded to out of sight.”</p>
</div>

<p>The rivalry between these two steamers terminated the
following year, when the <span class="smcap">Swift</span> was sold to the London, Leith
and Edinburgh Shipping Company, and sailed for Leith, via
Oban, Fort William and Inverness, on the 27th June, 1826.
The <span class="smcap">George Canning</span> was offered for sale by auction in June,
1831, but was evidently withdrawn. She appears to have been
sold subsequently by private treaty, and sailed, after repairs,
for St. Malo, Brittany, in June, 1833.</p>

<p>The well-known firm, G. &amp; J. Burns, of Glasgow, commenced
business as steamship owners in 1825. The style of the firm
at that time was James and George Burns, and their offices
were at 45, Miller Street, but in February, 1842, they changed
the style of the firm to G. &amp; J. Burns.</p>

<p>The first steamer employed by this firm was the new steampacket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
<span class="smcap">Ayr</span>, of 76 tons, built by John Wood &amp; Co., of Port
Glasgow, and having two engines of 30 h.p. each, by John
Nelson, Glasgow. The <span class="smcap">Ayr</span> was employed in the Glasgow and
Ayrshire and Galloway trade. On the 20th March following
(1826) Messrs. Burns despatched their first steamer from
Glasgow to Belfast. She was a new steamboat named <span class="smcap">Fingal</span>.
Her length was 116 feet, her beam 21 feet 6 inches, and her
depth 12 feet 4 inches. She had two engines of 50 h.p. each.
She could accommodate thirty passengers with sleeping berths,
had several horse boxes on deck, and carried 180 tons of cargo.
The rates for passage were, in the cabin, 20s., and on deck, 3s.;
and the days of sailing from Glasgow, Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>Three years later (March, 1829) Messrs. Burns began their
Liverpool and Glasgow service. The pioneer steamer of this
service was the <span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>, a small steamer, 120 tons deadweight,
and fitted with two engines of 30 h.p. each. The Messrs.
Burns have ceased for many years to have any connection with
the Glasgow, Ayr and Galloway trade, but on the other two
stations, Belfast and Liverpool, they have maintained
continuous services for nearly eighty years. They were also
largely interested in the Glasgow and West Highland Passenger
Services, but sold their interests in 1851 to Messrs. David
Hutcheson &amp; Co. These services are now conducted by the
fleet of splendid steamships owned by the Messrs. MacBrayne of
Glasgow.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On Saturday, the 30th June, 1825, a steam-packet sailed from
the Thames for Hamburg, the first that had ever made that voyage.</p>

<p>The following month (16th August) the first steamer sailed
from England (Falmouth) to Calcutta, via the Cape. This
was the wooden paddle-steamer <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span>, 470 tons burthen,
120 h.p. Further particulars of this vessel are given in
Chapter IX. (Steamship Routes to India and the East).</p>

<p>Some idea of the marvellously rapid growth of steam navigation
may be gathered from the fact that in the year 1825,
just ten years after the arrival of the first steamers on the
Thames and Mersey, there were 44 steam vessels on the stocks
at Liverpool of from 250 to 500 tons each; while in London no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
less than 45 companies had been formed to establish steam-packets
in every quarter of the globe. Owners of sailing ships
became alarmed for their future, and at a meeting held in
Swansea, on the 14th December, 1826, a resolution was passed
to send a petition to the House of Commons, praying for the
intervention of Parliament to protect sailing vessels against the
further increase of steamers.</p>

<p>Amongst those steamers referred to as building at Liverpool
was the <span class="smcap">Erin</span>, the largest steamer (up to date of launching) ever
built in Liverpool. Her principal dimensions were, length
161 feet, breadth 44 feet. Her tonnage was 500 tons gross,
and she was propelled by engines of 180 h.p., by Fawcett and
Co. She was launched from Mr. Rathbone’s yard in February,
1826, and was intended to trade regularly between London and
Belfast, calling at Southampton, Plymouth and Falmouth.
Her owners were the Belfast Steam Navigation Co., and she
cost £20,000.</p>

<p>Her (late) Majesty’s Steam-Packets, for the conveyance of
mails and passengers between Liverpool and Kingstown, commenced
sailing on the 29th August, 1826. Captain John
Emerson, R.N. (late Commander of the <span class="smcap">St. George</span> steam-packet),
was appointed Captain of one of these Royal Mail
Steamers, of which there were four, all built at Liverpool, and
each of 300 tons burthen.</p>

<p>The City of Dublin Steam-Packet Company commenced a
regular steamship passenger service between England, Ireland
and France in June, 1827. The route was from Belfast to
Dublin, thence to Bordeaux. Passengers from the North of
England were carried by the Company’s steamers between
Liverpool and Dublin, connecting at the latter port with the
steamer to France. The pioneer steamer of the service was
the <span class="smcap">Leeds</span>, which sailed on her first voyage from Belfast on
Sunday, 17th June, and from Dublin on the following Wednesday,
continuing to sail at fortnightly intervals during the
season. The venture was so successful that the Directors of
the Company, the following April, added the steamers
<span class="smcap">Sheffield</span> and <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span> to the service, and increased the
sailings to the 1st, 10th and 20th of each month.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Soon after steam navigation began to attract attention in
Great Britain, a public meeting was held in London (1822),
for the purpose of forming a steamship company to trade
between England and India. It was the intention of the
promoters of the meeting that the packets should proceed to
India by way of the Cape of Good Hope, the route by which
the bulk of the trade of Europe with the East had been
carried since the time of Vasco da Gama. At this meeting it
was decided that Lieut. (afterwards Captain) Johnston should
proceed to Calcutta, with a view to interesting the East India
merchants in the proposed undertaking.</p>

<p>Lieut. Johnston proceeded to India <em>via</em> Egypt, and although
he was commissioned to advocate the Cape route, he was convinced
on this journey of the greater advantages of the route
by Suez, and afterwards became one of its most ardent
supporters. Several meetings were held in Calcutta after his
arrival there, at one of which, held on the 17th December,
1823, it was announced that the Governor, Lord Amherst,
cordially approved of the proposal to establish steamship
communication between England and India, and that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
prepared to recommend his Council to grant as a premium<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
“a gift of 20,000 rupees to whoever, whether individuals or
a company, being British subjects, should permanently,

<p>An additional 80,000 rupees were raised in India for this
object, of which amount the Rajah of Oude subscribed
12,000. On receipt of this gratifying news in London,
another meeting of those interested was held, at which

<p>The <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span> was a paddle-steamer, built of wood, by
Messrs. Gordon &amp; Co., Deptford, at a cost of £43,000. Her
length of keel was 122 feet, beam 27 feet, and she registered
479 tons. She had a copper boiler in one piece, which
weighed 32 tons, and cost £7,000. Her engines were 120
horse power, capable of propelling her in calm weather at the
rate of 8 knots per hour. She sailed with 17 passengers from
London for Calcutta on the 16th August, 1825, and arrived
at the latter port on the 7th December following. She
occupied 113 days on the passage, partly under steam and
partly under sail, and inclusive of ten days stoppages for the
purpose of obtaining fresh supplies of fuel. She did not
return to England, but was purchased by the Indian Government
for £40,000, the East India Company being at that time
engaged in the first Burmese War. She was employed
carrying despatches between Calcutta and Rangoon, and on
the occasion of the Treaty of Malwa, she saved the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
six lacs of rupees by reaching Calcutta in time to prevent
the march of troops from the upper provinces.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span> arrived at Calcutta from England
she was piloted by a young man, a mate in the Bengal Pilot
Service, named Thomas Waghorn.</p>

<p>Mr. Waghorn was born at Chatham in 1800, and was, consequently,
in his twenty-sixth year when he acted as pilot for
the <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span>. He had served four years in the Royal
Navy, and was afterwards for twelve years in the service of
the East India Company as pilot, subsequently rejoining the
Royal Navy, in which he remained until he obtained his
commission as Lieutenant. He was selected in 1827, by the
Indian Government (Calcutta Steam Committee), for the
purpose of establishing steam navigation between England
and India. He visited London, Liverpool, and Manchester,
but could not obtain sufficient financial support for a regular
service of steamers <em>via</em> the Cape of Good Hope. Hearing that
it was the intention of the East India Company to despatch
the <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span> to Suez, he offered his services as Courier to
the East to Mr. Lock (Chairman of the East India Company),
and to Lord Ellenborough (President of the Board of Control).
His offer of service was accepted, and he left London on the
28th October, 1829, taking the overland route, <em>via</em> Trieste, to
Alexandria, where he arrived on the 27th November. His
instructions were to proceed with his despatches for the
Governor of Bombay (Sir John Malcolm), by the steampacket
<span class="smcap">Enterprize</span> from Suez, but owing to a breakdown of
her machinery, the steampacket was not at Suez to meet him.
There being no steamer to take him on to his destination,
Mr. Waghorn embarked on an open native boat, and sailed
down the Red Sea, being subsequently picked up by the
East India Company’s sloop <span class="smcap">Thetis</span>, which had been sent to
meet him, and which brought him to Bombay. The day previous
to the arrival of Mr. Waghorn at Bombay, the East
India Company had despatched the steamer <span class="smcap">Hugh Lindsay</span>
to Suez to take up the sailing of the disabled <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span>.
The <span class="smcap">Hugh Lindsay</span> continued to make one round voyage
between Bombay and Suez annually until 1836, during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
north-east monsoons, not being sufficiently powerful to make
the passage during the south-west monsoons. In 1836 the
Court of Directors of the East India Company decided to
place on the station two new and more powerful steamers.
These were the <span class="smcap">Atalanta</span>, of 616 tons burthen and 210 horse
power, built in 1835 at a cost of £36,652; and the <span class="smcap">Berenice</span>,
of 664 tons and 230 horse power, built the same year at a cost
of £40,124.</p>

<p>While a regular steamship service was thus being established
between the Isthmus of Suez and Bombay, the British
Government had established a service of Admiralty packets
between Falmouth and Cadiz, Gibraltar, Malta, and Corfu.
From Malta the mails were conveyed to Alexandria by other
of H.M. ships. Prior to 1830 the Admiralty packets were all
sailing brigs, but on the 5th February of that year the
<span class="smcap">Meteor</span>, the first of the steampackets, sailed from Falmouth
to the Mediterranean. She was followed by the steampackets
<span class="smcap">African</span>, <span class="smcap">Carron</span>, <span class="smcap">Columbia</span>, <span class="smcap">Confrance</span>, <span class="smcap">Echo</span>, <span class="smcap">Firebrand</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hermes</span> and <span class="smcap">Messenger</span>.</p>

<p>About 1834 Messrs. Bourne, of Dublin, the principal owners
of the Dublin and London Steampacket Company, were
induced by the Spanish Minister in London to start a line of
steamers between London and the Peninsula. They placed
the management of the steamers in the hands of Messrs.
Willcox and Anderson, a London firm with whom they had
had some previous transactions. Messrs. Willcox and
Anderson were well acquainted with the trade to the
Peninsula, having been engaged in it, at first with sailing
vessels, and afterwards with chartered steamers. The new
line was called the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company,
and Mr. James Allan, then a clerk in the Dublin Office of the
Dublin and London Steampacket Company, was sent to
London to assist Messrs. Willcox and Anderson in the
management.</p>

<p>The first steamer of the service was probably the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
<span class="smcap">Tar</span>, belonging to the Dublin and London Steampacket Company,
which had been chartered in 1834 to Don Pedro, and
subsequently to the Queen Regent of Spain, Messrs. Willcox
and Anderson being the chartering brokers. The “Graphic”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Xmas Number for 1901 states the <span class="smcap">Wm. Fawcett</span> was the
first P. &amp; O. steamer, and the “P. &amp; O. Pocket Book” (1900
edition) heads the list of the past and present fleet of the company
with the name of the same vessel, built in 1829. It is
only necessary to say here that neither the Peninsular Steam
Navigation Company nor the P. &amp; O. Steam Navigation
Company were in existence at that date. The <span class="smcap">Wm. Fawcett</span>
was certainly built that year by Caleb Smith, and engined
by Fawcett and Preston, both Liverpool firms. For some
time she was engaged as a ferry boat on the Mersey, and in
the early thirties she was employed as a regular trader
between London and Dublin. She probably was chartered
for a short time to the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company
in 1835 or 1836, as she does not appear in the company’s
advertised sailing list for 1838.</p>

<p>In the latter year the fleet consisted of the following
vessels, from London to Vigo, Lisbon, Cadiz and Gibraltar:—<span class="smcap">Tagus</span>,
800 tons gross, 300 h. p.; <span class="smcap">Royal Tar</span>, 650 tons gross,
264 h. p.; <span class="smcap">Braganza</span>, 650 tons gross, 264 h. p.; <span class="smcap">Iberia</span>, 690
tons gross, 200 h. p.; <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>,<a id="FNanchor_14b" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> 500 tons gross, 160 h. p.;
<span class="smcap">City of Londonderry</span>,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> 500 tons gross, 160 h. p. Branch
steamers, <span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>, <span class="smcap">Guadalquiver</span>, <span class="smcap">Estrella</span> and <span class="smcap">Sol</span>.</p>

<p>In 1837 the Government advertised for tenders from steamship
owners for the conveyance of the mails between
Falmouth and the Peninsula, which up to that time were
conveyed by sailing brigs which left Falmouth for Lisbon
every week, “wind and weather permitting.” In response to
this advertisement two companies, the British and Foreign
Steam Navigation Company, and the Peninsular Steam Navigation
Company, sent in tenders. The former company
having failed to show that it had adequate means for the
efficient performance of the Postal service, the Government
concluded a contract, on the 29th August, 1837, with the
Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, by which that company
agreed to convey monthly the whole of the Peninsular
mails for an annual subsidy of £29,600, afterwards reduced
to £20,500. The first steamer to be despatched under this
contract was the <span class="smcap">Iberia</span>, in September, 1837, calling at Vigo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Oporto, Lisbon and Cadiz, on its passage to and from
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The British Government in 1839 entered into an arrangement
with the French Government to send letters to and from
India through France by way of Marseilles. The mails were
conveyed between Marseilles and Malta by an Admiralty
packet, and between Malta and Alexandria by another
Admiralty packet. This arrangement did not work satisfactorily,
and the Government advertised for tenders for a
line of steamers, to run direct from England to Alexandria
and <em>vice versa</em>, touching only at Gibraltar and Malta. The
steamers were to be of sufficient power to perform the voyage
in not more than three days beyond the time then occupied in
the conveyance of the mails <em>via</em> France, and the cost was not
to exceed the amount required for the maintenance of the
small and inefficient Admiralty packets then employed.</p>

<p>Four competitors tendered for the contract, but that of the
Peninsular Company was accepted, it being the lowest
(£34,200), and containing also an offer to convey at a reduced
rate all officers travelling on the public service, and <em>bona fide</em>
Admiralty packages gratuitously.</p>

<p>At this time much pressure was brought to bear on the
Government to induce it to subsidize a proposed line of
steamers between Falmouth and Calcutta <em>via</em> the Cape of
Good Hope. These steamers, according to the “Times” of
the 11th November, 1838, were to make the passage in thirty
days.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Liverpool</span>, of 1,540 tons and 464 horse power,
built by Sir John Tobin, of Liverpool, and intended for the
Liverpool and New York trade; and the <span class="smcap">Oriental</span>, of 1,600
tons and 450 horse power, were the steamers offered by Messrs.
Willcox and Anderson, and approved by the Admiralty,
to convey mails between England and Alexandria, calling
at Gibraltar, and combining the two mail services of
the Peninsular and the Oriental, thus constituting the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.
Subsequently, the company was requested to provide
two steamers, one to be not less than 250 horse power,
and the other to be 140 horse power, for the Malta and Corfu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
branch of the mail service, which was done at a cost to the
country of £10,712 per annum, less than the cost of maintaining
the Admiralty packets previously employed.</p>

<p>In September, 1842, the P. &amp; O. Company obtained a
contract for carrying the mails between Calcutta and Suez.
The contract was granted very reluctantly by the East India
Company, and only after much pressure had been brought to
bear on it by the Home Government.</p>

<p>On the 24th September, 1842, the P. &amp; O. Company
despatched its first steamer to India <em>via</em> the Cape of Good
Hope. She was the paddle-steamer <span class="smcap">Hindostan</span>, of 2,017 tons
gross and of 520 horse power. On her arrival at Calcutta she
was placed on the service between Calcutta, Madras, Ceylon
and Suez. Other steamers were despatched speedily from
England, and in 1844 the company was in a position to enter
into another contract with the Government for a monthly
service from Ceylon, to Penang, Singapore, and Hong Kong.
For the premier service (Suez-Calcutta) the company received
£115,000 per annum, or at the rate of 20s. per mile, and for
the Ceylon-Hongkong service £45,000, or at the rate of
about 12s. per mile.</p>

<p>In connection with the Eastern services, coaling stations,
docks, store establishments, and in such places as Suez and
Aden, even fresh-water supplies had to be, and were, provided
and organised.</p>

<p>At this period, and until the completion of the Railway
from Alexandria to Suez, the passengers and cargo carried by
the P. &amp; O. steamers were conveyed across Egypt in a somewhat
primitive manner. The Mahmoudieh Canal enabled
the company to transport its passengers and cargo from
Alexandria to the Nile, whence they proceeded by steamer to
Cairo, and thence through the desert on the backs of camels,
a distance of less than 100 miles, to Suez.</p>

<p>As it was notorious that the mail service between Suez and
Bombay was conducted by the East India Company at a cost
of upwards of 30s. per mile by steamers vastly inferior in
speed and accommodation to the P. &amp; O. steamers, which
maintained the mail services to India and the principal ports
of China at an average rate of about 17s. per mile, the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
naturally demanded that the Suez-Bombay service should be
taken out of the control of the East India Company, and
placed in the hands of those competent to work it more
efficiently and with greater economy. The demands of the
public, although confirmed by the Parliamentary Committee
of 1851, were successfully resisted by the Court of Directors
until 1854, and it is questionable if even then, they would
have given up the service if (in consequence of the East India
Company having no steamer ready for them at Suez) the
Bombay mails had not been lost in a native sailing craft into
which they had been transferred at Aden.</p>

<p>The P. &amp; O. Company were applied to by the Government,
and undertook this service for the sum of £24,700 per annum,
or at the rate of 6s. 2d. per mile, resulting in a decreased
expenditure of about £80,000 per annum, as compared with
the expense incurred by the far less efficient East Indian
Navy.</p>

<p>In 1852, the P. &amp; O. Company extended its operations to
Australia, by means of a branch line of steamers from Singapore.
The following year saw an addition of no less than
eleven steamships to the company’s fleet. Amongst these was
the celebrated troopship <span class="smcap">Himalaya</span>, which continued in active
service until near the end of the century. At the time of her
launch she was the largest steamship afloat, and of
extraordinary speed. She cost £132,000 when fully equipped
and ready for sea. Her length was 340 feet, beam 44 feet
6 inches; her gross tonnage was 3,438 tons, and her engines
indicated 2,050 horse power.</p>

<p>Another famous steamer built for the P. &amp; O. in 1853 was
the <span class="smcap">Colombo</span> (steamship), which was engaged as a Government
transport during the Crimean War. Even Santa Claus
himself could not have been more eagerly welcomed than was
the <span class="smcap">Colombo</span> when she arrived off Sebastopol on Christmas
Eve, 1854, with provisions for the wounded soldiers and
sailors. She was originally a vessel of 1,864 tons gross, but
in 1859 she was lengthened amidships, and her tonnage
increased to 2,127 tons. The <span class="smcap">Himalaya</span> and the <span class="smcap">Colombo</span>
were two, out of eleven, P. &amp; O. steamships chartered to the
Government as transports during the Crimean War, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
vessels conveyed during the continuation of hostilities 1,800
officers, 60,000 men and 15,000 horses.</p>

<p>The first steamer of the P. &amp; O. Company fitted with compound
engines was the <span class="smcap">Mooltan</span> (steamship), of 2,257 tons,
built in 1860-1. Several succeeding steamers were fitted with
the same type of engines, but although the consumption of
fuel was decidedly less, the engines themselves proved so
unreliable that they were taken out of all the ships and
replaced by the old style of engines. “It was not until 1869”
(says Sir Thomas Sutherland, in the “P. &amp; O. Pocket Book,”
1900) “that the company succeeded in building a steamer
with high and low pressure machinery which could be considered
thoroughly successful.”</p>

<p>On the 17th November, 1869, the Suez Canal, the greatest
engineering work of the 19th century, was formally opened
by the Empress Eugenie, in the presence of numerous distinguished
men from all countries. While the benefits
conferred upon the world of commerce by the opening of this
canal can hardly be over-estimated, its influence upon the
fortunes of the P. &amp; O. Company was at first almost fatal.
The whole of the company’s business had to be re-organised,
and as speedily as possible a new fleet obtained adapted to the
changed requirements of the company’s services. This
transitory state continued for a period of five years, from 1870
to 1875, by which date the company’s re-organization was
sufficiently accomplished to enable them to transfer their
services from the Overland to the Suez Canal route. The
accelerated mails sent <em>via</em> Brindisi were still carried by the
Egyptian Railway between Alexandria and Suez, and continued
to be so carried until 1888, when they also were
transferred to the Canal route.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the earlier vessels of the company’s
fleet with the later. The <span class="smcap">India</span>, built in 1839, was a
vessel of 871 tons, and with engines of 300 horse power. Her
namesake, built in 1896, is a steamer of 7,911 tons, with
engines of 11,000 horse power. The <span class="smcap">Persia</span>, built in 1900,
has a slightly larger register (8,000 tons), with engines of the
same power. In 1901 four twin-screw steamers were added to
the fleet, the <span class="smcap">Syria</span>, <span class="smcap">Soudan</span>, <span class="smcap">Somali</span> and <span class="smcap">Sicilia</span>, each of 6,600<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
tons gross, with engines of 4,500 horse power, while 1903-4
witnesses the addition to the Company’s list of the <span class="smcap">Marmora</span>
and <span class="smcap">Macedonia</span>, 10,500 tons and 15,000 horse power, and the
<span class="smcap">Moldavia</span> and <span class="smcap">Mongolia</span>, 10,000 tons and 14,000 horse power,
as well as several cargo steamers of immense tonnage.</p>

<p>During the war in the Transvaal, as at the time of the
Crimean War, many of the steamers of the P. &amp; O. Company
were engaged by the Government as transports.</p>

<p>The following figures indicate the extensive operations of
the company:—In 1899 the mileage traversed by the
steamers of the fleet during the year was about 3,000,000
miles. The consumption of coal during that period was
625,000 tons. The dues paid to the Suez Canal Company
exceeded £272,000, while the sum expended in wages to
officers and crews amounted to £362,000.</p>

<p>In 1855 the Directors of the East India Company advertised
for steamers to carry the mails between Calcutta and Burmah,
a service inaugurated by the <span class="smcap">Enterprize</span> (see ante) in 1826,
and afterwards conducted by various vessels of the East Indian
Navy. Messrs. McKinnon &amp; Co., of Glasgow, tendered in
response to this advertisement, and their tender having been
accepted, they despatched the two steamers <span class="smcap">Baltic</span> and <span class="smcap">Cape
of Good Hope</span> to fulfil their contract. These vessels were
small and unsuitable for the intended service, and the result
would have been a serious financial loss to their owners, had
they not, soon after their arrival in India, been engaged for
transports on the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny.</p>

<p>The new company traded under the title of the Calcutta and
Burmah Steam Navigation Co., its first operations being confined
to the ports of Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon and Moulmein.
One of the two pioneer steamers, the <span class="smcap">Cape of Good Hope</span>,
collided with a P. and O. steamer and sunk in the Hooghly.
Another, the <span class="smcap">Calcutta</span>, of 900 tons, was totally lost off the
coast of Wicklow, when on her first voyage from the Clyde to
Calcutta. A fresh contract was entered into in 1862 with the
Indian Government, and in the same year the title of the
Company was changed to the British India Steam Navigation
Co., Limited. The terms of the new contract included the
transport of troops and stores at a mileage rate; a mail service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
every fortnight between Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon and Moulmein;
also a monthly service via the two latter ports to
Singapore; a similar service to Chittagong, and one to the
Andaman Islands; as well as one between Madras and
Rangoon; a fortnightly service between Bombay and Karachi;
and a service, once every six weeks, to various ports in the
Persian Gulf. New vessels were built and despatched for these
various services, and the traffic of the Company developed with
great rapidity.</p>

<p>The career of the Company was, however, not an unchequered
one. In addition to the two steamers referred to as lost during
the first year of the Company’s existence, must be added the
wreck of the <span class="smcap">Burmah</span> on the Madras coast, the loss of the
<span class="smcap">Bussorah</span> on her voyage to India, and the foundering of the
<span class="smcap">Persia</span> on her voyage from Rangoon to Calcutta, during one of
those fearful cyclones which periodically sweep the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, which for a time
adversely affected the fortunes of the P. and O. Co., proved
beneficial to the British India Steam Navigation Co. The
directors of the latter Company at once took advantage of the
facilities which it offered, and their steamer <span class="smcap">India</span>, requiring
new boilers, was despatched to England, and was the first
steamer to arrive in London with a cargo of Indian produce via
the Suez Canal. Since that date the Company has added
steamer to steamer until at the present date (1903) its fleet
(inclusive of the British India Association steamers) numbers
upwards of 120 vessels.</p>

<p>In July, 1891, Messrs. Bibby Brothers, of Liverpool (a firm
which was founded in 1807), established a direct service of
first-class and swift steamers between the United Kingdom and
Burmese ports. For half a century prior to 1901 Messrs. Bibby
had maintained steamship communication between Liverpool
and all the principal ports of the Mediterranean. Prior to the
construction of the Suez Canal, cargo from the East was carried
by the P. and O. to Suez, thence by rail to Alexandria, where
it was transhipped to the Bibby steamers, which loaded in
Alexandria for Liverpool.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">The first steamer to trade along the Pacific Coast of South
America was a small steamer, named the <span class="smcap">Telica</span>, in 1825.
She was owned and commanded by a Spaniard bearing a
Russian name, Mitrovitch. The venture proved a failure,
chiefly owing to the scarcity of fuel, and the unfortunate man,
in a fit of despair, fired his pistol into a barrel of gunpowder,
and blew up his vessel in the harbour of Guayaquil, destroying
himself and all on board, except one man.</p>

<p>The next person to attempt to establish steamship communication
along the Pacific Coast was an American citizen, Mr.
William Wheelwright, born in Newburyport, Mass., U.S.A.,
in 1798, and appointed United States Consul at Guayaquil in
1824. Mr. Wheelwright, notwithstanding the tragic fate of
the <span class="smcap">Telica</span> and her owner, was convinced of the importance
of steam communication to the development of the rich
resources of the western side of the South American
Continent, spent six years in arranging plans for steam communication
between the different Republics, and at last
obtained from the Peruvian, Bolivian, and Chilian Governments
the privilege of establishing and maintaining a steamship
service along their respective coasts for a period of ten
years. In pursuance of this object he came to England, and
secured the co-operation of several wealthy merchants, and
on the 17th February, 1840, a charter was obtained for the
establishment of the undertaking known as the Pacific Steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Navigation Company, together with a small subsidy for the
conveyance of the mails. It was not the intention of the founders
of the company to trade elsewhere than along the Pacific
Coast, and for this purpose a capital of a quarter of a million
pounds was thought to be sufficient. The capital consisted of
5,000 shares, £50 each. Only the amount required to build
two small steamers was called up. These steamers were the
<span class="smcap">Chili</span> and <span class="smcap">Peru</span>, each of about 700 tons gross register, with
engines of about 150 horse-power nominal. They were brig-rigged
paddle steamers, built of wood, by Charles Young and
Co., Limehouse, London, and engined by Miller &amp; Ravenhall.</p>

</figure>

<p>Owing in great measure to the scarcity of fuel on the
coast, the company, during the first five years of its existence,
sustained a loss of four-fifths of its paid-up capital, but the
shareholders courageously resolved to persevere with their
undertaking. The seat of management of the company was,
however, transferred from London to Liverpool (1846), and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
late Mr. William Just appointed Managing Director. The
following year (1847), the Directors were for the first time able
to declare a dividend, a modest two-and-a-half per cent.</p>

<p>In 1850, having obtained an extension of the Government
Postal contract, the Directors ordered four steamers, at a total
cost of £140,000. These steamers were named the <span class="smcap">Lima,
Santiago</span>, <span class="smcap">Quito</span> and <span class="smcap">Bogota</span>, and were each of about 1,000
tons gross and 300 horse-power nominal.</p>

<p>In 1856 the company’s service was re-organised by Mr. Just,
who visited the West Coast specially for that purpose.
During the same year the compound type of engines was
adopted in the company’s steamers, the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company being thus one of the earliest ocean steamship
companies to use this type of engine.</p>

<p>A supplemental charter was obtained in 1865, extending
the operations of the company, and authorising steamship
communication between the West Coast of South America,
and the River Plate on the East Coast.</p>

<p>As the profits of the company had been steadily increasing
for a number of years prior to 1867, it was resolved at a
meeting of shareholders, held in December of that year, to
establish a monthly line of steamers from Liverpool to the
West Coast of South America, <em>via</em> the Straits of Magellan, and
to increase the capital of the company to £2,000,000.</p>

<p>The first new steamer of the new service was the <span class="smcap">Pacific</span>,
1,630 tons gross register, 1,174 tons net, with engines of 450
horse-power. Her principal dimensions were, length 267 feet,
beam 40 feet, depth 17 feet. She was built on the Clyde in
1864, by Randolph Elder &amp; Co., and cost £61,855. After
trading for about three years on the Pacific Coast, she sailed
from Valparaiso for Liverpool in May, 1868, as the pioneer
steamer of the new mail service. During this year five
steamers of about 3,000 tons each, specially built for the
maintenance of this service, were added to the company’s
fleet. These were the <span class="smcap">John Elder</span>, <span class="smcap">Magellan</span>, <span class="smcap">Patagonia</span>,
<span class="smcap">Araucania</span> and <span class="smcap">Cordillera</span>.</p>

<p>So profitable was the Liverpool trade to the West Coast, the
Directors determined in 1870 to make the sailings fortnightly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and in that year they added the steamers <span class="smcap">Chimborazo</span>, <span class="smcap">Cuzco</span>,
<span class="smcap">Garonne</span>, <span class="smcap">Lusitania</span> and <span class="smcap">Aconcagua</span> to the fleet.</p>

<p>In December, 1871 they recommended a further increase
of the company’s capital to £3,000,000, with a view of making
the service from Liverpool a weekly one. During the year
they had greatly increased the number of the company’s ocean
steamers, having built in 1871 seven steamers, each of about
4,000 tons gross, viz., the <span class="smcap">Sorata</span>, <span class="smcap">Illimani</span>, <span class="smcap">Cotopaxi</span>,
<span class="smcap">Galicia</span>, <span class="smcap">Corcovado</span>, <span class="smcap">Puno</span> and <span class="smcap">Potosi</span>.</p>

<p>In July, 1872, the capital of the company was raised to
£4,000,000, and the steamers <span class="smcap">Valparaiso</span> and <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> were
added to its fleet, and in the following year the <span class="smcap">Iberia</span> and
<span class="smcap">Liguria</span>.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Orellana.</span> Pacific Steam Navigation Co., Ltd.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In addition to the above steamers, which were all built for
the Liverpool to West Coast service, the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company built during the years 1869 to 1873
inclusive, eighteen steamers for its Pacific Coast service.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Iberia</span> and <span class="smcap">Liguria</span> were the last of the barque-rigged,
clipper-bow type of steamer built for the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company. The succeeding vessels of the fleet
have as a rule four pole masts and a straight stem.</p>

<p>Although the trade between Liverpool and the West Coast
of South America had increased with marvellous rapidity, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
increase in the company’s tonnage had more than kept pace
with it. It was found that the combined passenger and cargo
trade would not support a sailing each week, and the sailings
were reduced to two each month. As a consequence of the
reduced number of sailings, as many as nine of the company’s
steamers were at one time laid up for want of employment.
In 1878 the Directors were fortunately able to charter four of
their vessels, the <span class="smcap">Chimborazo</span>, <span class="smcap">Lusitania</span>, <span class="smcap">Cuzco</span> and <span class="smcap">Garonne</span>,
to Messrs. Anderson, Anderson &amp; Co., who in that year founded
the Orient Line of steamers from London to Australia. In
1882, when the latter company decided to double its sailings,
the Pacific Steam Navigation Company made arrangements
to employ several additional steamers in the Australian
service. Although the Pacific Company was the first to
establish steamship communication between Great Britain and
the West Coast of South America, it has had to share the
traffic in later years with the Gulf Line of steamers belonging
to the Greenock Shipping Company, and with the steamers
belonging to Messrs. Lamport &amp; Holt.</p>

<span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, first screw passenger steamer trading from Hull.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Early in the year 1830, the French Government, fitted out an
expedition against the Dey of Algiers, and an agent of the
former was instructed to contract with the City of Dublin and
the St. George Steam-Packet Companies for the employment
of some of their first-class boats as transports in the expedition.
The vessels chartered were ordered to proceed immediately to
Toulon to embark French troops for service in North Africa.
This was the first instance of steam vessels being extensively
engaged in warlike expeditions. At this date, Portugal was
engaged in a prolonged and sanguinary civil war, in the course
of which vessels belonging to both of the famous Liverpool
steamship companies were again employed.</p>

<p>Don Miguel (surnamed the Usurper) had about the year
1826 assumed the government of Portugal. It is calculated
that in the short space of five years he imprisoned 26,270 of his
beloved subjects; 16,000 were transported to various places;
13,000 were forced to fly from his paternal government; 13,700
perished on the scaffold; and 5,000 were either in concealment
or wandering about the kingdom to avoid a similar fate.
Finally, Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, on behalf of his
daughter Donna Maria of Portugal, took active measures to
recover the throne. A number of British steamers were
engaged as transports or privateers in the civil war that ensued.
Amongst other vessels was the “ill-fated steamer”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> <span class="smcap">Rival</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
which sailed from Greenock on the 22nd December, 1832,
bound for Oporto, with about 400 volunteers for Dom Pedro,
and foundered in Galway Bay, with the loss of nearly 500 lives.
Some spars, bedding, and ship’s papers were washed ashore,
but as not one of the passengers or crew escaped, no particulars
can ever be known of the circumstances attending the fatal
disaster.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord Blaney</span> was one of several of the St. George
Steam-Packet Company’s vessels chartered for the same service.
It appears from a record of magisterial proceedings (August,
1831) before Mr. H. Leach, of Milford, that the agents employed
by Dom Pedro hired 200 seamen at Liverpool, and induced
them to ship on board the <span class="smcap">Lord Blaney</span>, under a pretext that
they were merely wanted to navigate British transports across
the Atlantic, to convey some regiments of Portuguese from
Rio de Janeiro to Europe; but no sooner had the <span class="smcap">Lord Blaney</span>
got fairly into the Irish Channel than the officers threw off the
mask, and acknowledged their destination to be Belle Isle, for
the purpose of manning Dom Pedro’s fleet. Finding themselves
thus entrapped, the seamen exhibited signs of mutiny,
and a violent gale of wind having forced the steamer into
Milford Haven for shelter, the whole body of tars went ashore
with bed and baggage, declaring their intention not to fight
under any flag but that of England. After completing her
engagement with Dom Pedro, the <span class="smcap">Lord Blaney</span> was placed on
the Liverpool and Newry service, and on the 18th December,
1833, she was lost with all hands (45) whilst on a voyage from
Newry to Liverpool. A subscription list was opened for the
benefit of the families and relatives of the crew and passengers.
The City of Dublin Steam-Packet Co., although in active opposition
to the St. George Steam-Packet Co., headed the list with
the handsome donation of £100. Two, at least, of the City of
Dublin Steam-Packet Co.’s vessels took part in the Portuguese
war, the <span class="smcap">Leeds</span> and the <span class="smcap">Birmingham</span>. The latter steamer,
under the command of Captain Beazley, arrived at Falmouth
about the 15th July, 1833. She brought despatches from Lagos
which contained intelligence of the most important and decisive
nature, nothing less than the complete defeat and capture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the fleet of the Usurper. The news was received with the
utmost satisfaction in England as well as Portugal.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> steamship sailed from Hamburg to Hull on
Friday, 19th October, 1845, with a number of passengers and a
full general cargo. Shortly after leaving the Elbe she encountered
a north-west gale, and after beating against it for two
days, she was driven on to a dangerous bank called the
Memmett, near Juist, at the entrance to the river Memm.
The moment she took the shoal, the sea, which was running
very high, swept several overboard. The long boat was
launched and an attempt made to reach the shore, but owing
to it being crowded it capsized, and every soul in it perished.
From advices received, it appears that altogether sixteen of the
passengers and three of the crew were lost. Those who
remained on board the vessel, after severe privations, were
rescued. The <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> was owned by Mr. Pimm, of Hull;
was several years old; was about 250 tons burthen, and was
rigged as a three-masted schooner. She was worked by a
screw propeller, and was the first vessel of that description
engaged in the passenger trade from the port of Hull.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A Quarter of a century had elapsed since the launch of Bell’s
<span class="smcap">Comet</span> on the Clyde. In the interval, all the chief ports of
Great Britain and Ireland, and several of the continental ports,
had been connected by steampacket services. So early as 1828
it had been proposed to establish steam communication between
the West of Ireland and America, and an Act of Parliament
for incorporating the Valentia Transatlantic Steam Navigation
Company was obtained. The proposed capital was £24,000, in
shares of £50 each. The first steamer was estimated to cost
£21,000. She was to be a vessel of about 800 tons burthen,
driven by engines of 200 h.p., and was expected to make six
round voyages per annum. She was to accommodate 50 cabin
and 50 steerage passengers, and to carry 200 tons cargo, exclusive
of bunkers. It appears from the following extract from
the “Liverpool Albion” of the 14th December, 1835, that
although the projectors of the Valentia Company advertised in
1828 that the company was “to commence immediate operations,”
its first sailing had not taken place seven years later.
The scheme fell through for want of support, but in 1835 it was
started afresh in conjunction with the railway from London,
the Post Office Packets, and the Valentia Railway. The extract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
is valuable also as containing Dr. Lardner’s famous dictum
concerning the possibility of direct steam navigation between
Liverpool and New York:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“Steam Communication with America.</p>

<p>“Dr. Lardner then proceeded to observe that one of the
grandest projects which had ever occupied the human
mind was at present in the process of actual accomplishment.
He meant that of constructing a great highway
for steam intercourse between New York and London—between
the capital of the New World and that of the
Old. Part of the highway was in process of formation.
It consisted of several stages—that of the railroad from
London to Birmingham; that from Birmingham to
Liverpool, and the steam intercourse with Dublin; but
there was another stage—that from Dublin to Valentia,
which had as yet hardly been thought of. Ireland was
a country which, with all her political disadvantages, was
blest by nature with a vast number of physical advantages,
and amongst the rest he might reckon a vast
number of excellent harbours. No country in the world
could boast of so many fine and spacious ports, bays and
roadsteads. She had many harbours on her west coast
which would serve admirably as stations for steam conveyance
across the Atlantic; but Valentia had been
selected as the extreme westerly point suitable for that
purpose. It was a fine anchoring ground by an island
of that name on the coast of Munster. The distance
from Dublin to this point was under 200 miles, which
might be traversed in about 8 hours. The nearest point
on the continent of North America to this point of
Ireland was St. John’s in Newfoundland. The distance
between the two was about 1,900 miles; thence to
Halifax, in Nova Scotia, there would be another run of
550 miles, and from that to New York would not exceed
the admissible range; but touching at Halifax would be
desirable for the sake of passengers. The only difficulty
would be as to the run from Valentia to St. John’s; and
the voyage from Dublin to Bordeaux and back, a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of between 1,600 and 1,700 miles, with the same stock of
coals, came very near this distance. It must be observed
that westerly gales blew almost all the year round across
the Atlantic. They were produced by the trade winds
being the compensating cause that restored the balance
which these served to destroy, according to that beautiful
principle in nature which always provides a remedy for
any derangement in the deranging cause itself. As a
last resource, however, should the distance between
Valentia and St. John’s prove too great, they might make
the Azores a stage between, so that there remained no
doubt of the practicability of establishing a steam intercourse
with the United States. As to the project, however,
which was announced in the newspapers, of making
the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was,
he had no hesitation in saying, perfectly chimerical, and
they might as well talk of making a voyage from New
York or Liverpool to the moon. The vessels which
would ultimately be found the best adapted for the
voyage between this country and the United States
would be those of 800 tons, which would carry machines
of 200 horse-power, and would be able to stow 400 tons
of coal. To supply a 10 horse-power daily required an
expenditure of a ton of coals, and, consequently, 200
horse-power would require 20 tons of coal daily; but if
the vessel carried 400 tons of coal only, it would not be
practicable to undertake a voyage which would require
the whole of the quantity. They must make an allowance
of 100 tons for contingencies. Thus, in reckoning
the average length of the voyage which might be undertaken
by such a vessel, we might safely calculate upon
300 tons of coal, which would be sufficient for 15 days,
and it might fairly be concluded that any project which
calculated upon making longer voyages than 15 days
without taking in a fresh supply of coals, in the present
state of the steamboat, must be considered chimerical.
Now, the average rate of speed of the Mediterranean
packets was 170 miles per day, and the utmost limit of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
steam voyage might be taken at 2,550 miles; but even
that could not be reckoned upon.”</p>
</div>

<p>In justice to the memory of Dr. Lardner, it is only fair to
state that, in the eighth edition of his “Steam Engine, &amp;c.,”
1851, pp. 294-309, he denies that he ever stated that “a steam
voyage across the Atlantic was a physical impossibility.”</p>

<p>During the winter of 1832-3, the Quebec and Halifax Steam
Navigation Co. built at Quebec a steamer, which they named
the <span class="smcap">Royal William</span>. She was a vessel of 1,370 tons B.M.;
length over all, 176 feet; breadth, outside paddle-boxes, 43 feet
10 inches; inside, 27 feet; depth of hold, 17 feet 9 inches;
draught laden, 13 feet. Her engines of 180 h.p., constructed
in Birmingham by Boulton &amp; Watt, were forwarded to Canada,
and fitted on board the <span class="smcap">Royal William</span> at Montreal, whither
she had been towed by the steamboat <span class="smcap">British America</span>. After
trading for several months between Quebec and Pictou, Nova
Scotia, the station for which her owners had built her, she was
advertised to sail for London. In accordance with this
announcement she was despatched from Quebec on the 5th
August, 1833, and after calling at Pictou, N.S., where she took
on board a further supply of coal at 15s. per chaldron, she
proceeded direct to Cowes, Isle of Wight, accomplishing the
voyage of about 2,500 miles in seventeen days. This voyage
is remarkable as being the first instance of a vessel crossing
the Atlantic from America by the use of steam only.</p>

<p>After the completion of her trans-Atlantic voyage, the <span class="smcap">Royal
William</span> was sold to the Spanish Government, who changed
her name to the <span class="smcap">Ysabel Secunda</span>, and fitted her up as a man-of-war
carrying six guns. She took part in the first Carlist
war and, finally, was totally wrecked on the rocks off the harbour
of Santander, Spain.</p>

<p>After strenuous and prolonged efforts, Dr. Julius Smith
succeeded in organising (1836) a Transatlantic Steamship
Company, bearing the title of the British Queen Steam
Navigation Co. The capital of the Company was fixed at
£1,000,000 sterling, and its secretary was the celebrated Mr.
MacGregor Laird. The shares were promptly subscribed for,
and the Directors placed a contract with Messrs. Curling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Young, Blackwall, London, to build their pioneer steamship,
the <span class="smcap">British Queen</span>. The order for the engines was placed
with a Glasgow firm, Messrs. Claude Girdwood &amp; Co. This
firm, however, before they had finished the work entrusted to
them, became bankrupt, and a new contract was made with
Mr. Robert Napier, the famous Clyde engineer, to supply the
engines. It was at first the intention of the Directors (as
stated in their prospectus) to build a vessel of 1,862 tons
burthen, but before the completion of the ship they decided to
increase her size to 2,400 tons. Although contracted for in the
summer of 1836, it was not until 24th May, 1838, that the
<span class="smcap">British Queen</span> was launched. This unfortunate delay, caused
by the bankruptcy of Messrs. Girdwood &amp; Co., enabled a rival
company at Bristol to build and equip their steamer, the
<span class="smcap">Great Western</span>, before the <span class="smcap">British Queen</span> could be got ready
for her service. In order to save the prestige of their Company
the Directors of the <span class="smcap">British Queen</span> chartered from the St.
George Steam-Packet Co. the steamer <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>, and advertised
that she “would leave London for New York on Wednesday,
the 28th of March, 1838, calling at Cork Harbour; and would
start from thence on the 2nd April, returning from New York
on the 1st of May.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The sailing from Cork Harbour was,
however, delayed, waiting the arrival of the steampacket <span class="smcap">Ocean</span>
from Liverpool with the mails and passengers, until the
morning of the 4th of April. She started on this memorable
voyage at 9 o’clock on the morning of the date named, having
on board 94 cabin passengers. Three days later (7th April,
1838)<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> she was followed across the Atlantic by the <span class="smcap">Great
Western</span>, from Bristol for New York, with goods and passengers.
As the dates of the intended sailings of both steamers
had been conveyed to New York, their arrival at that port was
eagerly looked for. They both arrived on the same day, the
<span class="smcap">Sirius</span> early in the morning of Monday, the 23rd April, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the <span class="smcap">Great Western</span> in the afternoon. The excitement which
prevailed on the arrival of these steamers was described as
follows by the New York Press: —</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At 3 o’clock p.m. on Sunday, the 22nd of April, the
<span class="smcap">Sirius</span> first descried the land, and early on Monday
morning, the 23rd, anchored in the North River immediately
off the Battery. Nothing could exceed the excitement.
The river was covered during the whole day with
row-boats, skiffs, and yawls, carrying the wondering
people out to get a close view of this extraordinary vessel.
While people were yet wondering how the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> so
successfully made out to cross the rude Atlantic, it was
announced about 11 a.m. on Monday, from the telegraph,
that a huge steamship was in the offing. ‘The <span class="smcap">Great
Western</span>!—the <span class="smcap">Great Western</span>!’ was on everybody’s
tongue. About 2 o’clock p.m. the first curl of her
ascending smoke fell on the eyes of the thousands of
anxious spectators, and a shout of enthusiasm rose on
the air.... Thus the grand experiment has
been fairly and fully tested, and has been completely
successful. The only question now in the case is that of
expense. Can steampackets be made to pay?”</p>

<p>During the early part of her voyage westwards, the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>
experienced strong head winds, during which she only steamed
4 to 5 knots per hour. During the latter portion, the weather
was favourable, and she made good progress, averaging 9½
knots. She sailed from New York as advertised on the 1st of
May, and reached England on the 18th idem after a voyage of
sixteen days. The <span class="smcap">Great Western</span> left New York on the 7th
of May and arrived at Bristol on the 22nd, being fourteen days
on the passage. There was a remarkable difference in her
consumption of coal on the two voyages, accounted for, probably,
first by the stormy weather referred to as experienced by the
<span class="smcap">Sirius</span> on her outward voyage, and secondly by the prevailing
westerly winds on the homeward run. On the voyage Bristol
to New York, the <span class="smcap">Great Western</span> averaged per day 208 knots,
or 8·2 knots per hour, with a total consumption of 655 tons of
coal. On her homeward voyage she averaged 213 knots per
day, or nearly 9 knots per hour, with a total consumption of
only 392 tons of coal. Fuller details of the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> will be
found in the History of the Cork Steamship Co. in Part II. of
this work. It is but fair to state that she was only half the size,
and had only half the power of her famous rival. The principal
dimensions of the two vessels were as follows:—</p>

<p class="no-indent">They were both paddle-steamers, built of wood, the former
designed by Brunel, and engined by Maudsley, Sons &amp; Field,
and the latter built by Menzies, of Leith, and engined by
Wingate &amp; Co., of Glasgow. For upwards of eight years the
<span class="smcap">Great Western</span> continued to sail regularly between Bristol and
New York, on which station she was very popular with passengers.
She was sold in 1847 to the Royal Mail Steampacket
Co., in which service she was also a favourite for several years.
In 1857 it was the opinion of the Directors that she could not
compete profitably with modern boats, and she was therefore
broken up at Vauxhall.</p>

<p>About the date of the despatch of the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> from Cork, the
Directors of the City of Dublin Steam Packet Co. had under
consideration the formation of a Transatlantic Steam-Packet
Co., with sailings to and from Liverpool. The steamers of this
Company were amongst the largest and most famous afloat. A
meeting of Directors was held in the Committee Room, Water
Street, Liverpool, at which it was decided to open up the new
service by the despatch of the P.S. <span class="smcap">Royal William</span> as soon as
she could be got ready for the voyage. The <span class="smcap">Royal William</span>
was practically a new steamer, having been built in 1836, being
one of four steamers built to compete with the Admiralty
steamers for the mail service between Liverpool and Kingstown.
She proved herself to be faster than any of the Government
mail steamers, and when placed on the Dublin and
London station, made a passage from Falmouth to Kingstown,
260 miles, in 23 hours. She was built by Wilson, of Liverpool,
and engined by Fawcett &amp; Preston, of the same city. Her
length was 175 feet (being 3 feet less than the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>), beam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>27 feet, depth of hold 17 feet 6 inches. Her capacity was 817
tons burden, and she was propelled by engines of 276 h.p.
Her coal consumption was about 17 tons per 24 hours, and in
fairly smooth water her speed was 11½ knots per hour. She
had cabin accommodation for eighty passengers. She sailed
from the Prince’s Pier on Thursday evening, 5th July, 1838,
having on board thirty-two passengers. Sixty-four years
afterwards the present author had several interviews with Mr.
Brownrigg, the City of Dublin Co.’s Customs Clerk, who took
out the Customs clearance for the <span class="smcap">Royal William</span>, and who in
spite of his great age remembered clearly the appearance of the
vessel as she steamed down the River Mersey on that midsummer
evening so long ago. Although she carried no cargo
on that voyage, she was so deeply laden with coal for fuel—coal
that filled her bunkers, her holds, and even her well-deck—that
her paddles were buried six feet, her sponsons were
submerged, and it was possible by leaning over the bulwarks
to wash one’s hands in the water that surged at the vessel’s
sides. Naturally it was an event in which the townspeople of
Liverpool and the residents on the Cheshire side of the river
took the deepest interest. As she began to move she was
greeted with enthusiastic cheers from thousands of spectators
who crowded the piers and lined the river side, whilst cannon
were fired from Woodside, Monks Ferry, Rock Ferry, and from
the steamboats on the river. The <span class="smcap">Royal William</span> completed
the passage from Liverpool to New York in nineteen days, and
the homeward passage in fourteen and a half days.</p>

</figure>

<p>Amongst those who were present at the meeting held in the
Water Street Committee Room was Sir John Tobin, who had a
large steamer nearing completion on the stocks. It was agreed
that this vessel should sail alternately with the <span class="smcap">Royal William</span>
between Liverpool and New York. At her launch, Sir John
Tobin’s steamer was named the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>. She was a vessel
of 1,150 tons, with engines of 404 h.p. She started on her first
voyage on the 20th October, 1838, but experienced such bad
weather that she put back to Cork on the 26th, after having
accomplished about one-third of her voyage. She remained at
Cork for ten days, and again proceeded to sea on the 6th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
November, arriving at New York on the 23rd, after a passage
of sixteen and a half days. It was on board this steamer that
Mr. Samuel Cunard crossed the Atlantic, for the purpose of
inducing British capitalists to take up his scheme of mail
steamers between Liverpool, Halifax and Boston.</p>

<p>After making a few voyages to and from Liverpool and New
York, the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span> was lengthened, her capacity being
increased by 393 tons, and at the same time her name was
changed to the <span class="smcap">Great Liverpool</span>. Her new owners, the
P. and O. Co., employed her in their mail service between
Southampton and Alexandria. Her career as a Royal Mail
steamer was a short one, as she was lost off Cape Finisterre on
the 4th February, 1846.</p>

<p>The first great disaster in the Transatlantic steamship trade
occurred in the spring of 1841. On the 12th March of that
year, the steamship <span class="smcap">President</span> sailed from New York, bound
for Liverpool, with a full list of passengers. She was a new
steamer, having been launched fifteen months previously (7th
December, 1839) by Messrs. Curling &amp; Young for account of
the British and American Steam Navigation Co., of Bristol.
The <span class="smcap">President</span> was one of the largest and most powerful steamships
of her day, her register tonnage being 2,366 tons, and
her engines indicated 540 horse-power. On her first voyage,
she sailed from Liverpool for New York at 2 p.m. on the 1st
August, 1840, arrived at New York 2 p.m. on the 17th idem;
sailed from New York 2 p.m. on the 1st September, and arrived
at Liverpool 2 p.m. on the 17th of the same month, being
exactly sixteen days on both her westward and her eastward
passage. She apparently lay up for the winter, and resumed
her sailings in the spring of the following year. She left New
York for Liverpool on her third homeward voyage on the 12th
March, 1841, having on board 136 passengers. After leaving
New York she disappeared, with all her living freight, from
human ken. As day after day passed, the utmost anxiety
arose, both in the mercantile world and amongst the relatives
of the passengers and seamen, as to the cause of her detention.
Other steamers and ships reported very heavy weather in the
Atlantic, and the presence of unusual quantities of ice in very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
low latitudes. The newspapers of the period were filled with
references to the ill-fated vessel, with suggestions that her
engines had broken down, and that she had drifted out of the
track of homeward bound steamers. Multitudinous and conflicting
rumours passed into circulation of her wreck having
been seen in various places, and a thousand speculations as to
the cause and certainty of a catastrophe, and the subsequent
fate of those on board, kept alive the agony of those interested
in her. Her fate remains one of the sad mysteries of the ocean,
as no trace of her wreck was ever discovered, nor a single
survivor from the tragedy.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In October, 1838, the British Government, being convinced of
the superiority of steamships over sailing brigs, advertised for
tenders for the conveyance of the North American Mails by
steamers.</p>

<p>Amongst the tenders sent in, that of Mr. Samuel Cunard, of
Halifax, was accepted as being the lowest, and in many other
respects the most favourable for the public.</p>

<p>With a view of carrying out his scheme for establishing a
mail steamship service between England and North America,
Mr. Cunard came to London and called upon Mr. Melville,
Secretary to the East India Company, to whom he was personally
known. From Mr. Melville he received a letter of introduction
to Mr. Robert Napier, the celebrated Clyde engineer
and shipbuilder, by whom he was introduced to Mr. George
Burns, of Glasgow, and Mr. David MacIver, of Liverpool. Both
these gentlemen favourably regarded the proposals of Mr.
Cunard, and interested themselves so energetically in the matter
that in a very short time the whole of the requisite capital for
the formation of the Trans-Atlantic Mail Steamship Company
was subscribed. A sketch of the history of this famous
Company (afterwards known as the Cunard Company) will be
found in the second part of this volume.</p>

<p>Although the <span class="smcap">British Queen</span> had proved an entire success,
and was a great favourite with transatlantic travellers, her
owners resolved to build a second ship, which would not only
exceed her in size, but which should also include all the latest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
improvements the art of naval construction could then command.
This was the famous <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>. She was the
first Western Ocean steamship constructed of iron, and the
first and only one for several years that was propelled by a
screw propeller instead of paddle-wheels. She was considered
a colossal steamer in her time, and excited quite as much
public interest as did the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> at a later period.
Her principal dimensions were, length of keel 289 feet, between
perpendiculars 296 feet, over all 322 feet, her breadth was 51
feet, depth of hold 32 feet 6 inches, her measurement 2,984 tons,
and her engines 1,000 h.p. She originally carried six masts,
two of which were forward and four aft of the funnel. She
was built at Bristol, from plans furnished by Mr. Patterson of
that City, who also had designed the <span class="smcap">Great Western</span>. Her
engines and boilers were constructed in, and fitted on board the
vessel at, the Company’s own works, as no outside engineers
would undertake the contract. But, owing to an extraordinary
oversight on the part of the consulting Engineer, it was then
found that she was imprisoned in the dock, being so deeply
immersed by the weight of her machinery as to be unable to
pass out. Although she was launched on the 19th July, 1843,
owing to the above unfortunate mistake, she was not ready for
sea until December of the following year. On her passage
from Bristol to London she encountered a severe storm which
thoroughly tested her seagoing qualities, and through which
she passed triumphantly. Her arrival in the Thames was
awaited with great interest by the public, whose curiosity had
been excited by the numerous references to the vessel published
in the daily and illustrated papers. A long and interesting
account of this trial voyage, from which the following particulars
are taken, was published in the “Illustrated London
News,” under date of the 1st February, 1845. From this
article it appears that the <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> left Bristol for
London at 7 p.m. on Thursday, 23rd January, 1845. At the
time the ship got under weigh, it was blowing a fresh breeze
from the S.S.W., which at 3 a.m. on Friday had veered to the
N.W. and increased to a gale, and there was a counter swell
from the Irish Channel, causing a disagreeable and heavy cross
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>sea. The gale continued to increase, and was for a considerable
time on her starboard bow; yet, notwithstanding this, in the
face of the gale, and a heavy head sea with a strong ebb tide,
she made five and a half knots per hour. At twenty minutes
past twelve, when about fifteen miles to the westward of Lundy,
she was struck on the starboard bow by a tremendous sea,
which must have contained two or three thousand tons of
water. The shock for a moment seemed to paralyse the vessel
and to bring her to a standstill; this, however, was but for one
moment; the vessel recovered the shock instanter, and continued
to brave the gale as though nothing had happened to
check her progress. Some idea of the force of the concussion
may be formed from the damage done to the vessel. Three
of her starboard bulls eyes were stove in, together with their
frames, the diagonal bends of her forecastle deck were bent, the
woodwork started two inches upwards, a portion of the carved
figurehead carried away, also the wooden fittings of her bulkhead,
the iron sheathing of both bows split above deck in two
places. The gale continued until 5-30 p.m., when it became
more moderate. At 8-45 p.m. the <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> rounded
the Land’s End, and at 10-40 was off the Lizard proceeding
up the Channel at the rate of 10½ knots per hour. The
Captain (Lieut. Hoskin, R.N.), was of opinion that neither
the <span class="smcap">Great Western</span>, nor any other Royal Mail (Paddle)
Steamer, could have made such headway under the same
circumstances by at least from one to one and a half knots
per hour.</p>
<br>
<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p0800_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p0800_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Great Britain s.s.</span> (1845), from an old Engraving.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On Saturday, 25th January, at 12-10 a.m., she was abreast
of Falmouth, and proceeded up channel, with light winds from
the S.W. at an average speed of 12 knots per hour. At 12-45
p.m. she entered the Needles passage, and when off Cowes, at
2-15, the engines were stopped to land despatches. At 2-18
again proceeded on her course. Upon arriving at Spithead,
Captain Hoskin took his vessel under the stern of H.M.S.
<span class="smcap">Apollo</span>, fired a gun, and gave her three cheers, which were
returned by the crew and troops on board. At 1-40 a.m. on
Sunday (26th), the <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> came to an anchor in the
Downs, having ran from the time she rounded the Land’s End,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
three hundred and fifty miles at an average speed of twelve
knots per hour.</p>

<p>At 7-45 a.m. the vessel was got under weigh again from the
Downs, and upon rounding the North Foreland, and steering
through the Queen’s Channel, encountered a stiff gale from the
W.N.W. The <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>, however, met it in gallant
style, and made nine and a half knots against it. As she
steamed up the river, the crews of every vessel she passed ran
on deck to obtain a view of her, her great length, and her
singular appearance with six masts, rendering her an object of
considerable attraction. She arrived at Woolwich at 3-30 p.m.,
and at Blackwall a few minutes later. At both these places
there was an immense concourse of people assembled to witness
her arrival.</p>

<p>She remained at her anchorage at Blackwall nearly five
months, during which period she was inspected by many
thousands of the public. On the 22nd April H.M. Queen
Victoria, accompanied by Prince Albert and suite, paid her a
visit.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> left Blackwall on Thursday afternoon,
12th June, 1845. On passing Woolwich it seemed as if the
whole population had turned out to behold her. The Dockyard
was lined with the Naval and Military officers connected
with that depôt, whose cheers were loud and continued. She
had on board about eighty passengers, who had embarked for
a trip round the coast. After calling at several ports she
arrived in the Mersey about 9 o’clock on the evening of
Thursday, 3rd July, on which occasion she was anxiously looked
for by thousands, the pierheads and every available point on
the river being densely crowded. The <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> sailed on
her first voyage from Liverpool to New York on Saturday, 26th
July, at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, taking forty-five passengers,
and arrived out on the 10th August, at noon. On her return
voyage she left New York on the 30th August, having on board
fifty-seven passengers and 600 tons general cargo, and arrived
at Liverpool on the 15th September, at 8 a.m. She continued
to trade regularly between the two ports, her passenger list
steadily increasing, until the 22nd September, 1846, when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
stranded in Dundrum Bay, Ireland. She was, at the time of
the stranding, on a voyage from Liverpool to New York with
185 passengers. Fortunately the mishap was accompanied by
no loss of life. The cause of the disaster is explained by the
following resolution passed by the Directors of the Company:—“With
respect to the occurrences which preceded the stranding
of the unfortunate ship, as explained now by Captain Hoskin,
and by the Report of Captain Claxton to the Secretary, the
Directors are of opinion that the ship was stranded in consequence
of an error in judgment, into which it appears the
Captain was betrayed through the omission of a notice of St.
John’s light in the chart of this year, by which he was
navigating, and of the want of knowledge on his part of such
a light having been established, it being to the Directors
obvious that had the light been laid, Captain Hoskin would
have known that the judgment which led him at 8 o’clock to
put his ship in the proper course for the North Channel,
ought to have been persevered in.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> remained stranded for over eleven
months, but on the 25th August, 1847, she was floated off and
towed to Liverpool for repairs. After the completion of the
repairs she lay in the Liverpool Dock for about five years, and
then made one trip to New York, sailing from Liverpool on the
1st May, 1852. She sailed from New York on the 5th June,
and after a rapid passage of 10 days 23 hours arrived in Liverpool
on the 16th of that month. From that date she ceased to
be connected with the Transatlantic Trade, and her subsequent
history is sketched in the chapter devoted to the account of
steam communication with Australia.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Nine months after the despatch of the first Cunarder from Liverpool
to Halifax, the Admiralty accepted a contract from a newly-formed
steampacket company, to convey the mails between
England, the West Indies, and the Gulf of Mexico. This
company, which bore the title of The Royal Mail Steam Packet
Co., had an authorised capital of £1,500,000, in fifteen thousand
shares of £100 each. It commenced operations on an exceptionally
large scale, no less than fourteen large and powerful
steamers being at once ordered to be built for the service.
The steamers were to be each of 400 horse-power, and to be
capable of carrying guns of the largest calibre then in use on
H.M. war steamers. Like all other ocean steamers of the
period, they were constructed of wood, and were propelled by
paddle-wheels. Upon the complete delivery of these vessels to
the Company, the contract required one of them to sail twice
in each calendar month from England via Corunna and
Madeira to the various islands in the West Indies, specified
in the contract, and back “to such port in the British Channel
as the said Commissioners of the Admiralty shall direct.” The
scheme also embraced other places in the West Indies, the
Spanish Main, and the United States, for which mails were to
be carried. For the performance of these services, the Company
was to receive a subsidy at the rate of £240,000 per
annum in quarterly payments, the contract to commence on
the 1st December, 1841, or if possible earlier, and to continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
in force for ten years, subject to twelve months’ notice from
either party for its termination. Notwithstanding this large
subsidy, the operations of the Company during the first year
resulted in a heavy loss, the Directors’ balance-sheet, presented
at the first meeting of the shareholders, showing a
deficit of £79,790 16s. 8d. Before this meeting was held, one-half
of the capital had been paid up, and another call of £10
per share was sanctioned at the meeting; but as it was found
that even this was insufficient for the requirements of the
Company, the Directors appealed to Government for further
assistance. In response to this appeal the Government
generously consented to reduce the annual mileage to be
traversed by the Company’s ships, which by the original contract
was 684,816 miles, to 392,976 miles, without any reduction
of the annual subsidy of £240,000. This liberal concession
was estimated by the Directors to effect a saving to the
Company of £125,000 per annum. Unfortunately during the
second year of its existence, the Company lost two valuable
steamers, which more than counterbalanced the bonus it had
obtained from Government. Trade, however, increased so
rapidly and profitably, that in the following year (1843) the
Company had recouped its losses, and had a surplus of receipts
over expenditure amounting to £94,210, and in 1844 to
£147,749.</p>

<p>In 1850 the Government made a fresh contract with the
Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. for a further term of ten years
from the 1st January, 1852, the subsidy being raised to
£270,000 per annum, but the Company were required to undertake
the additional expense of a monthly service to the Brazils,
which increased the mileage to be performed annually from
389,448 to 547,296 miles, and at the same time reduced the
mileage from 12s. 3d. to 9s. 10d. per mile. The Company was
also required to increase the speed of its steamers on the West
Indian line from 8 knots to 10 knots per hour, and to add five
new steamers to its fleet, each of 2,250 tons burden and 800
horse power. This second contract was altered in 1857, and its
period of currency extended two years, one condition introduced
being of an extraordinary nature. It had reference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
an amalgamation with the European and Australian Mail
Company, for the conveyance of the mails via Egypt, to and
from Australia. This arrangement proved a great failure,
owing to the complete collapse of the latter Company. A
second condition required the acceleration of the mails between
England and Rio de Janeiro. The Company was also required
to provide three new steamers of 3,000 tons burden and 800
horse-power for the Atlantic West India service, and a fourth
of smaller dimensions to ply between Rio and the River Plate.</p>

</figure>

<p>In 1864 the second contract expired, and fresh arrangements
were made, reducing the annual subsidy to £172,914. At the
same time it was stipulated that the speed of the steamers in
the West India Transatlantic service should be increased to
10½ knots per hour.</p>

<p>The postal contract was again renewed in 1874; but in
consequence of adverse articles and letters which had appeared
in the public press, and because several members of Parliament
had insisted that the service should be thrown open to public
competition, the Directors of the Royal Mail Steam-Packet
Co. found themselves compelled either to abandon the service
altogether, or to accept a much smaller subsidy than they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>hitherto received for carrying the mails. They adopted the
latter alternative, and undertook the conveyance of the West
India mails for an annual payment of £84,750—being about
one-third of the amount of the first subsidy. The company in
addition received the sum of £2,000 per annum to cover the
cost of the steamers calling at Plymouth to land the mails
instead of carrying them on to Southampton, the final port of
destination.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>On and from the 1st of January, 1875, the mails were carried on
an entirely fresh basis. The contract with the Government
was for a service twice a month from Southampton: payment
to be according to the weight of postal matter conveyed by the
steamers, and the contract was terminable by six months’ notice
given by either party to the contract.</p>

<p>Although on the North Atlantic screw steamers had been
employed in rapidly increasing numbers since 1850, it was not
until twenty years later that the Directors of the Royal Mail
Steam Packet Co. substituted screw steamers for paddle-wheel
steam packets in their service.</p>

<p>The first fleet of the Company consisted of vessels built of
wood, but so indeed were the pioneer steamers of the Cunard,
P. &amp; O., and other historical steamship companies. The course
taken by the Company’s vessels was free from the dangers from
ice and fogs, such as are encountered by steamers engaged in
the North Atlantic trades, yet during the first eight years of
the Company’s operations it lost no fewer than six of its
steamers. The <span class="smcap">Isis</span> struck on a reef off the coast of Bermuda
and sank on the 8th October, 1842. The <span class="smcap">Solway</span> was lost 20
miles west of Corunna on the 15th April, 1843. The <span class="smcap">Medina</span>
was wrecked on a coral reef near Turk’s Island on the 12th
May, 1844. The <span class="smcap">Tweed</span> was totally lost on the 12th February,
1847; and in 1849, the <span class="smcap">Forth</span> was wrecked on the same reefs
that had caused the destruction of the <span class="smcap">Tweed</span>. The <span class="smcap">Actæon</span>
was lost in 1850 on a shoal near Carthagena; and in 1852 there
was lost by fire the <span class="smcap">Amazon</span>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p><br>

</figure>

<p>An event occurred on the 8th November, 1861, which
occasioned considerable public excitement, both in Great
Britain and in the U.S.A. It was during the struggle between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>the Northern and Southern States, and two of the Commissioners
of the Confederate States were forcibly removed from
the Royal Mail steamer <span class="smcap">Trent</span>, while on their way to Europe,
by the officers and crew of the Federal man-of-war <span class="smcap">San
Jacinto</span>. This high-handed action, which was not repudiated
by the Federal Government, was inexcusable, and the tone
adopted by a great portion of the press of the Northern States
was ludicrous, and unworthy of a great people.</p>

<p>In 1871 there was launched from the yard of Messrs. John
Elder &amp; Co. two splendid screw steamers to the order of the
Royal Mail Co. These steamers were the <span class="smcap">Tagus</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Mozelle</span>, both steamers being 3,252 tons gross register and
600 nominal horse-power. On her official trial trip the <span class="smcap">Tagus</span>
attained an average mean speed of 14·878 knots per hour, a
result which was slightly surpassed by her sister ship the
<span class="smcap">Mozelle</span>, the average mean speed of the latter on her trial trip
being 14·929 knots per hour.</p>

<p>At the same time Messrs. Elder &amp; Co. effected an extraordinary
improvement in the <span class="smcap">Tasmanian</span>, an iron screw
steamer the Royal Mail Co. had purchased from the unfortunate
European and Australian Steam Navigation Co. This
vessel was fitted with compound engines, and on her first
voyage afterwards from Southampton to St. Thomas, occupying
14 days 2 hours, she consumed 466 tons of coal, against her
former consumption of 1,088 tons on a voyage occupying 14
days 13 hours.</p>

<p>Since that date all the additions to the Company’s fleet have
been screw steamers, and it now (1903) consists of 22 ocean
steamers, with a gross tonnage of 87,855 tons, in addition to
9 coast steamers employed as feeders to the mail services.</p>

<p>In the first year of the present century, Messrs. Elder,
Dempster &amp; Co. established a service of mail steamers between
Bristol and Jamaica. A detailed account of this service, which
is known as the Imperial Direct West India Mail Service,
Limited, will be found in the second part of this volume.</p>

<p class="no-indent">International rivalry in the Transatlantic.—The Collins Line and the
Cunard Co.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">For upwards of nine years Great Britain had held a monopoly
of the transatlantic steamship business. America could and
did build sailing vessels that were unsurpassed by those
belonging to any other nation; her Baltimore clippers, Boston
packets, and New York liners were all of them vessels of the
highest class and reputation. But apparently Americans could
neither build, nor own ocean steamers that were capable of
successfully competing with British owned steamships. At
least, it is a matter of history that from 1838 to 1847 all the
steamships that crossed the North Atlantic sailed under the
British flag, with one exception.</p>

<p>On the 15th September, 1845, Messrs. Forbes &amp; Co.
despatched from New York their auxiliary steamship <span class="smcap">Massachusetts</span>.
She was practically a full-rigged ship, 751 tons
O.M., fitted with an engine of 170 horse-power. This engine
had two cylinders each 3 feet stroke and 26 inches diameter.
Steam was generated in two “waggon boilers,” each 14 feet
long, 7 feet wide and 9 feet high. Her propeller was made of
composition metal, and could be raised out of the water when
not required. Her engine room, boilers, bunkers, &amp;c., were
situated in the lower after hold, and occupied a space equal to
one-tenth of the cubic capacity of the ship. Her engines were
capable of driving her in smooth water at the rate of about 8
knots per hour, on a consumption of 9 tons anthracite coal per
24 hours. The length of the <span class="smcap">Massachusetts</span> was 161 feet, her
beam 31 feet 9 inches, and her depth of hold 20 feet. She had
a full poop, extending to the mainmast (and consequently
forward of the funnel), in which there was accommodation for
35 first-class passengers. Her entire cost with machinery complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
in all respects was £16,000. She made two round
voyages between New York and Liverpool, and in June, 1846,
was chartered to the U.S. Government to carry troops to the
Gulf of Mexico. The Government were so well pleased with
her that they afterwards purchased her, and she took part in
the siege of Vera Cruz. Subsequently her name was changed
to the <span class="smcap">Farralones</span>, and she continued in the U.S. Navy until
about 1870, when she was again sold. Her new owners
removed her machinery and renamed her the <span class="smcap">Alaska</span>.</p>

<p>Obviously the <span class="smcap">Massachusetts</span> was not intended to compete
against full-powered ocean steamships, and it was not until
1847 that the first American line of steamers to Europe was
established. This was a line of steamships to run between New
York and Bremen, calling at Southampton. The pioneer
steamer of the line, the <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, sailed on her first voyage
from New York for Southampton on the same day (June,
1847) that the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, belonging to the Cunard Company,
sailed for Liverpool. This was the first ocean race between
American and British steamships. Theoretically the American
steamer was incomparably superior to the other. She was
much larger and had double the power; she was new, while
her rival had been buffeted by the Atlantic billows for seven
years. Quoth the editor of the “New York Herald”: “We
have to say that if the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> beats the <span class="smcap">Washington</span> over
(and they both, we understand, start the same day), she will
have to run by the deep mines, and put in more coal.” The
<span class="smcap">Britannia</span> did not “run by the deep mines and put in more
coal,” but she won the race by two full days.</p>

<p>Great pressure was subsequently brought to bear on Congress
in order to obtain a subsidy for an American mail service to
Great Britain. Those in favour of the subsidy argued that it
was humiliating to their pride as a great maritime people, that
foreigners and commercial rivals should wrest from them the
virtual monopoly of ocean steam conveyance, especially
between the United States and Europe, and they complained
that the ocean mails along their southern coasts had been
placed in the hands of foreign carriers, sustained and protected
by the British Government under the forms of contract to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>carry the British mails; while the Cunard Line, between
Liverpool and Boston, via Halifax, constituted the only
medium of regular steam navigation between the United
States and Europe.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Britannia</span>. Cunard Steamship Co.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It may be appropriate to state here, that in addition to
carrying the British mails from Liverpool to North America,
the Cunard Company, early in 1850, obtained a contract from
the British Government for the conveyance of the mails
between Halifax, New York and Bermuda. The steam packets
employed in this service were the <span class="smcap">Alpha</span>, <span class="smcap">Beta</span> and <span class="smcap">Delta</span>,
small vessels each of 350 tons and 80 horse-power, and fitted
with a proper space for mounting an 18-pounder pivot gun.
The arrangements for carrying on the service were as follows:—Twenty-four
hours after the arrival of the packet from
Liverpool, one of these vessels left Halifax for Bermuda; at
the same time another left for St. John’s, while the third conveyed
the mails monthly between Bermuda and New York.
The payment for these services amounted to £10,600 per
annum, equal to 3s. per mile, while on the main line it was
11s. 4d. per mile. The following year the British Government
made another contract with the Cunard Company for a monthly
conveyance each way of the mails between Bermuda and St.
Thomas, upon such days as might be fixed by the Admiralty,
the one vessel engaged in it being in all respects similar to
those engaged in the Halifax and Bermuda service. The
amount of subsidy was £4,100 per annum, or equal to 4s. per
mile. This service connected the West Indies with the United
States and the North American provinces.</p>

<p>Following the example of the British Government, the
United States Congress resolved to subsidise a line of American
steamships between New York and Liverpool. The steamers
were to be of the highest class, possessing great speed and
superior passenger accommodation, and capable, besides, of
being converted at a small expense into war steamers. The
responsible task of establishing the line was undertaken by
Mr. E. K. Collins, of New York, after whom the line was
named. Mr. Collins had had considerable experience as a
shipowner, being well-known as the head of the Collins Line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
sailing packets between Liverpool and New York. Associated
with Mr. Collins in his later enterprise were many influential
American citizens, and their proposals were favourably received
by the American Government, and ultimately an agreement
was entered into, by which Mr. Collins and his colleagues
undertook to provide five first-class steam vessels and to maintain
a weekly mail service between New York and Liverpool,
each vessel performing twenty voyages annually, for which
service they were to receive $19,250 per voyage. It is evident
that the United States Government were prepared to pay most
liberally for the performance of the ocean mail service. At
par the subsidy represented £4,010 8s. 4d. per voyage. Assured
of this substantial income, Mr. Collins sought the assistance of
the most competent shipbuilders and engineers of the United
States, and on the completion of the contract, arrangements
were entered into for the construction of four vessels, to be
named the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>, <span class="smcap">Baltic</span>, <span class="smcap">Atlantic</span> and <span class="smcap">Pacific</span>, each to be
about 3,000 tons register and of 800 horse-power. The principal
dimensions of these celebrated steamers were—Length on
main deck, 282 feet; depth from the main deck, 24 feet; depth
under the spar deck, 32 feet; breadth of beam, 45 feet. They
had rounded sterns, three masts with suitable spars; four
decks, viz., lower, main, spar, and orlop deck, extending from
the engine room forward and aft. They were built chiefly of
live oak, planked with pitchpine, and were equal, if not
superior, in strength to any wooden steamers afloat. The
timbers, which were solid and bolted to each other, were
further strengthened by a lattice work of iron bands. All the
four steamers were beautiful models, and the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>, which
was esteemed the finest of the fleet, was familiarly known as
the “clipper of the seas.” She was built by Mr. W. H. Brown,
of New York, under the superintendence of Mr. George Steers,
who modelled the famous yacht America. Her equipment was
complete, and of the highest order, while her cabin accommodation
surpassed in comfort and elegance any merchant steamer
Great Britain then possessed. The engines of the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> and
her sister ships were of the “side-lever” type, the cylinder
having a diameter of 95 inches, with a 9 feet stroke. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
boilers of the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> and <span class="smcap">Baltic</span> were peculiar to the Collins
Line, and were designed by Messrs. Sewell and Faron, chief
engineers of the United States Navy. The latter of these two
gentlemen acted as chief engineer of the Company. The
boilers were arranged with double furnaces, and lower water
spaces connected by a row of vertical tubes, around which the
heated gases circulated, with a hanging bridge or plate, which
checked their otherwise rapid flow to the funnel, and rendered
the combustion more perfect. The average consumption per
24 hours by the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> was 83 tons anthracite coal, attaining
an average speed of 316·4 knots per day. Her maximum consumption
was 87 tons, with a speed of 320 knots in 24 hours.</p>

<p>These vessels were constructed so utterly regardless of
expense that to complete them it was found the cost would be
very greatly in excess of the estimates. The Government was
therefore appealed to for assistance. The appeal was generously
responded to. The United States Government not only made
an advance to the Company while the ships were being built,
but also released it from its obligation to build a fifth vessel as
originally contemplated, and increased the subsidy from
$19,250 to $33,000 per voyage. But for these benefits increased
speed was demanded. “We must have speed,” declared Mr.
Bayard, during the debate in Congress, “extraordinary speed—a
speed with which they (the Collins steamships) can overtake
any vessel which they pursue, and escape from any vessel they
wish to avoid; they must be fit for the purpose of a cruiser,
with armaments to attack your enemy (if that enemy were
Great Britain) in her most vital part, her commerce.” Happily
the contest was a commercial and not a national one, and the
Collins steamers were never required for the purposes of Mr.
Bayard’s hypothesis. They did, however, engage (and for a time
with apparent success) in a great contest with the Cunard
Company for the commercial maritime supremacy of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Atlantic</span>, the first of the Collins Line of steamers to
cross the ocean, arrived at Liverpool on the 10th May, 1850.
The breadth of beam of this vessel and her sister ships was so
great that they were unable to enter any existing docks at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>Liverpool, and a dock at the north end of the port was constructed
specially for their accommodation. The arrival of the
<span class="smcap">Atlantic</span> excited very great interest, which was increased
rather than lessened by the presence at Liverpool of the <span class="smcap">Asia</span>
R.M.S., just built for the Cunard Line, and which left for New
York on the following Saturday week.</p><br>

<p>The following description<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the interior decorations of the
<span class="smcap">Atlantic</span> may be taken as a general description of the whole of
the Collins steamers, and will be read with interest:—</p>

<p>Her saloon is 67 feet long by 20 feet wide. Her interior
fittings are truly elegant, the woodwork being of white holly,
satinwood, rosewood, &amp;c., so combined and diversified as to
present an exceedingly rich and costly appearance. In the
drawing room the ornaments consist of costly mirrors, bronze-work,
stained glass, paintings, &amp;c. Between the panels connecting
the staterooms are the arms of the different states of
the confederacy painted in the highest style of art, and framed
with bronze-work. The pillars between are inlaid with
mirrors, framed with rosewood, and at the top and bottom are
bronzed sea-shells of costly workmanship. In the centre of
each are allegorical figures representing the ocean mythology
of the ancients, in bronze and burnished gold. The ceiling is
elaborately wrought, carved and gilded. The cabin windows
in the stern are of painted glass, having representations of New
York, Boston and Philadelphia painted on each. There is in
addition another apartment equally beautifully arranged and
ornamented, for the exclusive use of ladies. Both apartments
are heated by steam, an improvement now for the first time
introduced in steamships. The dining room (60 feet long) is
furnished in an equally elegant style with the drawing room.
The staterooms, which are light and airy, are beautifully furnished
and ornamented, and combine every convenience that
practical science and experience could suggest. It would
occupy more space than can be spared to detail the magnificence
of the furniture of the <span class="smcap">Atlantic</span>; the carpets are of the
richest description; the table-slabs are of Brocatelli marble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Each stateroom has an elegant sofa; the berths are of satinwood,
and the curtains of rich damask.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Atlantic</span> left New York on the 27th April, 1850, with
nearly a hundred passengers, and a valuable cargo, under the
command of Captain West. Shortly after leaving Sandy Hook
she got entangled amongst some drift ice, which did considerable
damage to her floats. This mishap was a serious drawback
to her, inasmuch as the engines had to be worked at a
reduced rate to prevent the floats from being torn from the
wheels altogether, and the weather was too boisterous to admit
of them being repaired. During the five succeeding days, the
noble vessel continued to prosecute her voyage to the satisfaction
of her captain and all on board. On the 3rd May, however,
an accident of a more formidable nature occurred, one of
her condensers giving way. After a fruitless attempt to adjust
the machinery, the vessel having been hove to forty hours,
Captain West decided to pursue his course, the steam being
kept at a low point in consequence, which considerably retarded
the vessel’s progress during the remainder of her passage.</p>

<p>The American steamers were swifter than their British
rivals, and for a few years were the favourites with the
travelling public. According to a return published in the
“New York Herald” on the 1st January, 1853, the number of
passengers carried during the eleven months January to
November (inclusive), 1852, were:—</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the majority of passengers carried
were from New York to Liverpool, the explanation of this
unusual circumstance being that it was at the time of the great
rush to the Australian goldfields, when it was no uncommon
thing for a Melbourne packet to sail from the Mersey with
from five to six hundred passengers. Nor were the receipts
from passage money the only source of revenue available for
the Collins steamers. They were loyally supported by American
shippers and importers, and the receipts from freight were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
large, although the rate on fine goods had been lowered from
£7 10s. to £4 per ton.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the large income derived from these
sources, the service was only maintained for a period of about
ten years. The heavy disbursements and the numerous casualties
which befell the steamers, especially the loss of the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>
(as narrated in the following chapter) and of the <span class="smcap">Pacific</span>, with
all on board, led to the collapse of the company.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">The Loss of the Collins Liner <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On Wednesday, 27th September, 1854, about noon—Cape
Race bearing S.W. by W., 65 miles distant—the steamship
<span class="smcap">Arctic</span>, on her passage from Liverpool to New York, while
running through a very thick fog, was struck on the starboard
bow about 60 feet abaft the cutwater by an iron steamer.
The force of the impact made three large holes in the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>—two
below the watermark, one of which was about 5½ feet in
length and about 1½ feet broad. The fog was so dense that
neither vessel saw the other a minute before they collided.</p>

<p>The passengers on the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> were at lunch when their
vessel was struck, and they immediately rushed on deck.
Through the dense fog could be seen very indistinctly on the
starboard bow a screw steamer, which was afterwards found
to be the French merchant steamer <span class="smcap">Vesta</span>. No apprehension
of danger was felt by those on board the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>, and a boat in
charge of the chief officer was sent off to the rescue of the
passengers and crew of the other steamer. On board of the
<span class="smcap">Vesta</span> no hope was entertained of her ultimate safety, the
crew and passengers relying upon being taken off by the crew
of the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>. When the collision occurred there were
several men on the bow of the <span class="smcap">Vesta</span>, presumably on the lookout,
one of whom was killed and the others severely wounded.
As it was feared that the steamer was sinking, a rush was
made for the boats, and two were launched. The first boat
was swamped, but the second boat floated, and was at once
boarded by several of the passengers and two of the crew, who,
ignoring the captain’s orders to return on board, cut themselves
adrift, and abandoned their shipmates. While these
occurrences were taking place on the deck of the <span class="smcap">Vesta</span> the
<span class="smcap">Arctic</span> had disappeared in the fog, those on the <span class="smcap">Vesta</span> still
hoping, however, that she had not deserted them. Meantime,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
the officers on board the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> had discovered that there was
little hope of saving their vessel. Mrs. Collins, the wife of
the managing owner, with their daughter and son, were
passengers, and the captain’s first thought was for their
safety. They and several ladies were placed in a lifeboat, but
while it was being lowered one of its tackles gave way, and
all, with the exception of one lady who clung to a sailor
holding fast to the boat, were cast into the sea and drowned.
A second boat was lowered successfully, and stored with
provisions. It was soon filled with passengers—ladies and
gentlemen—but by a strange oversight on the part of the
officer in charge none of the crew accompanied them.</p>

<p>The difficulty and danger of lowering the boats was greatly
increased in consequence of the impossibility of stopping the
ship for that purpose, the pumps having been attached to the
main engines in the attempt to keep the vessel clear of water,
which was pouring into her through the breaches in her side.
Cape Race being within about four hours steaming distance,
she was headed in that direction, but after running about
fifteen miles the water had risen so high in the stoke-hole as
to extinguish the fires, and, in consequence, the engines
ceased to work. Almost immediately after the ship stopped,
the remaining lifeboats left the ship. There was one large
boat on deck, which was capable of carrying fifty persons, but
there were not sufficient seamen left on board to launch her,
and it is supposed that she was filled with passengers in the
hope that she might float off when the steamer sank.</p>

<p>In the Annual Register for 1854, it is stated that Captain
Luce and most of his officers exerted themselves with firmness
and energy while a hope remained, and the former probably
owed his life to his remaining at his post. When his steamer
sank he clung first to some floating wood, and afterwards got
on a floating paddlebox, on which eleven others had taken
refuge, of whom nine were swept away by the sea, the three
survivors being rescued by the <span class="smcap">Cambria</span>, of Glasgow. The
captain’s son was killed in his father’s arms by a piece of
wreck.</p>

<p>The conduct of Captain Duchesne, of the <span class="smcap">Vesta</span>, was most
praiseworthy. Finding that the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> had disappeared in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the fog, and that his own vessel had not sunk under him, he,
with the utmost promptitude, took measures for saving his
ship and passengers. He noticed that, although the steamer’s
bows were completely shattered, the forecastle bulkhead had
not given way, and this afforded some hope of safety. He at
once gave orders to lighten the vessel by the head, by
throwing overboard all the fish, cargo, passengers’ luggage,
&amp;c., which was in the forepart of the ship, all of which orders
were promptly obeyed, and by means of which the vessel’s
bows were raised considerably. Her head was raised still
more by cutting away the foremast, which had been damaged
by the collision. The captain next ordered about 150
mattresses, palliasses and other effects belonging to the crew
and passengers to be placed abaft the forecastle bulkhead,
over which were thrown sails, backed by boards and planks,
the whole being secured by cables firmly wrapped round all.</p>

<p>These operations occupied two days, after which Captain
Duchesne proceeded under easy steam for the nearest port
(St. John’s), which was entered on the 30th September. Most
providentially, considering the disabled condition of the
<span class="smcap">Vesta</span>, she entered the harbour of St. John’s before the rising
of a severe gale, which sprang up on the same day. The
energy, unwavering perseverance, and superior seamanship
exhibited by Captain Duchesne in bringing his vessel into
port, elicited the admiration and praise of all who visited the
ship.</p>

<p>The American Consul at St. John’s made every exertion to
procure vessels to go at once in search of the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> or her
boats. He succeeded in obtaining the brigantine <span class="smcap">Ann Eliza</span>,
whose owners (Messrs. Warren Bros.) generously gave her
without charge. She sailed from St. John’s on the 2nd
October, with instructions to cruise in the vicinity of the
catastrophe for three days.</p>

<p>The Right Rev. Dr. Field also promptly placed at the disposal
of the American Consul his yacht, the <span class="smcap">Hawk</span>, for the
same purpose.</p>

<p>The last moments of the <span class="smcap">Arctic</span> are thus graphically
described<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> by Mr. Baahlam, the second officer of the
steamer:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In about thirty minutes all the lower fires were out,
and, at the least, there were six feet of water in the
ship fore and aft. By this time the confusion amongst
the passengers was very great, but they used all efforts
to assist the crew to keep the pumps going, and in
lightening the ship forward for the purpose of getting
at the leak from the inside, which we found to be useless,
and numbers of them got into the boats, which
were still hanging to the davits. In forty-five minutes
after the collision I came up from the forehold, and
informed the captain that the water was on a level with
the lower deck beams, and that it was impossible to get
at the leak. I then asked him what he thought would
be the probable fate of the ship, when he stated his
belief to me that there was no hope of saving her. He
then told me to see to my boats. On going to those on
the port side I found them completely filled with men
and women, and no possibility of getting near them.
I immediately went to the starboard side and ordered
two of the crew to lower the guard boat, and asked the
captain what his intentions were, who replied that the
ship’s fate would be his. I then asked him if he would
not allow his son to go with me, as I intended to take a
boat, but he returned me the answer that he should
share his fate. I then jumped into the boat, and was
ordered by the captain to cut away the tackle falls, and
drop under the stern. I did so; at which time about
twenty persons, as I suppose, jumped overboard, of
whom seventeen or eighteen were picked up. I fell in
with another boat which had been lowered from the
other side, and lightened her of part of her complement,
leaving nineteen in her, and twenty-six in my own boat.
The last sight we had of the ship her guards were level
with the water, and the surface of the sea strewed with
human beings, who had jumped or fallen overboard—to
whom, however, it was impossible for us to render
any assistance; and we soon lost sight of all, as the fog
continued very dense. I then asked the boat’s crew
whether they were willing to be governed by me, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
was unanimously approved, and I was put in complete
command of both boats.</p>

<p>“We were then about sixty miles S.E. of Cape Race.
Deeming it my duty, for the safety of all, I took the
nearest course for the land, and, after pulling forty-two
hours, with nothing to guide us but the run of the sea,
which I took to be heaving from the southward, and in
a thick fog which lasted all the time, we reached Broad
Cove, some twelve miles North of Cape Race.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Arctic</span>, when she sailed from Liverpool on this ill-fated
voyage, had 365 souls on board, of whom only 87 were
saved. The hull, machinery, and equipment of this steamship
were insured for £115,000, as follows:—Underwritten in
the United States, £55,000; in London, £40,000; and in
Glasgow, £20,000.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vesta</span>, which sailed from St. Peter’s the day previous
to the collision, had 197 persons on board, viz., a crew of 50
men and 147 passengers; of these 13 were reported missing
when she arrived at St. John’s.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">Steamship Companies of the past.—Inman Line.—National Line.—Guion
Line.—Royal Atlantic Steam Navigation Co.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the early spring of 1850 Messrs. Tod and MacGregor, iron
shipbuilders and engineers, Glasgow, launched the iron screw
steamer <span class="smcap">City Of Glasgow</span>, a vessel of 1,600 tons and 350 horse-power.
During the spring and summer of that year she made
several voyages between Glasgow and New York, but in the
latter part of the year she was purchased by the Liverpool, New
York and Philadelphia Steamship Company, and sailed from
Liverpool to Philadelphia on the 17th December, 1850. This
vessel was the pioneer of what is better known as the “Inman”
Line. This ill-fated vessel left port on 1st March, 1854, with
four hundred and eighty persons on board, and was never again
heard of. In 1851 the Inman Company purchased the steamship
<span class="smcap">City of Manchester</span>, built also by Tod &amp; MacGregor.
Her registered tonnage was 2,125 tons; her length 274 feet,
and her breadth 38 feet. She had a clipper bow and bowsprit,
four masts square rigged on the fore and main masts, with her
funnel between the main and mizzen masts. Other iron screw
steamers, all having the beautiful clipper bow for which this
line was noted, were quickly added to the fleet, comprising the
<span class="smcap">Kangaroo</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Baltimore</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Washington</span>, <span class="smcap">City of
Boston</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Bristol</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Limerick</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Lincoln</span>,
<span class="smcap">City of London</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Durham</span>, <span class="smcap">City of New York</span>, <span class="smcap">City
of Paris</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Antwerp</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Brooklyn</span>, <span class="smcap">City of
Brussels</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Montreal</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Chester</span>, <span class="smcap">City of
Chicago</span>, <span class="smcap">City of Richmond</span> and <span class="smcap">City of Berlin</span>.</p>

<p>During the first five years of its existence, the Inman Company
maintained a fortnightly service between Liverpool and
Philadelphia, but in 1857 it enlarged the area of its operations
by making New York one of its ports of arrival and by establishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
a fortnightly line thither. On the collapse of the
Collins Line, Mr. Inman at once assumed their dates of sailing,
and increased the service to once a week, and was appointed
to carry the United States mails between England and
America. Nor were the Inman steamers, though screws, less
swift than their predecessors. Their later steamers far surpassed
the swiftest steamers of the Collins Line, and one of
these, the <span class="smcap">City Of Paris</span>, in 1869 conveyed H.R.H. Prince
Arthur to America in six days twenty-one hours, the quickest
passage (up to that date) ever made to any port of the New
World from Cork.</p>

<p>Mr. Inman specially directed his attention to the conveyance
of emigrant passengers across the Atlantic, and he and Mrs.
Inman, greatly to their credit, made a voyage in one of their
earliest emigrant steamers, expressly for the purpose of
ameliorating the discomforts and evils hitherto but too common
in emigrant ships. The following table shows how successful
he was in catering for the emigrant passenger trade:—</p>

<p>Of the vessels named in the preceding page the <span class="smcap">City of
Washington</span> and <span class="smcap">City of Boston</span> met with the sad fate that
overtook the <span class="smcap">President</span> and the <span class="smcap">Pacific</span>. They sailed, but
never reached the desired haven, and in course of time were
posted “missing.” Two of them, the <span class="smcap">City of London</span> and the
<span class="smcap">City of Limerick</span>, were sold to Messrs. W. H. Ross &amp; Co., and
sailed for some time between London and New York. The
<span class="smcap">City of Antwerp</span> was purchased by Messrs. William Johnston
and Co., who changed her name to <span class="smcap">Thanemore</span> and employed
her for several years in their Liverpool and Baltimore trade.
By a strange fatality, each of the three steamers last named,
sailed from its respective port and was never afterwards heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
of. The first two disappeared in 1881, and the third in 1890.
The <span class="smcap">City of Richmond</span> was sold to a firm who were the first to
employ ocean liners for ocean pleasure cruising, and for two or
three summers she sailed from Newcastle to the Norwegian
fjords.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Mr. William Inman, which occurred in
1881, the management of the line was taken over by Messrs.
Richardson, Spence &amp; Co. Since then it has undergone
several changes. Its title of Inman Line was discontinued,
and that of “American” Line adopted, and its British headquarters
transferred from Liverpool to Southampton. It is
now (1903) one of the group of Atlantic steamship companies
included in the “Morgan” combine.</p>

<p>In 1863, a number of Liverpool merchants and shipowners,
anticipating a large trade would arise between this country and
the Confederate States of North America on the termination
of the civil war then raging, formed themselves into a company
under the title of the National Steam Navigation Co.,
with a capital of £700,000. It was the intention of the promoters
of the company to establish a regular service of first-class
steamships between Liverpool and the Southern States.
The requisite capital was quickly subscribed, and three steamships
were promptly acquired; but, alas! the hoped-for peace
did not arrive as soon as the promoters anticipated. Under
these circumstances the Directors decided to enter into competition
with the Cunard and Inman Companies for a share of
the passenger and goods trade to and from the Northern States.
The pioneer vessel of the new company was the <span class="smcap">Louisiana</span>,
which vessel sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool
to New York in the year 1863. She was followed
by the <span class="smcap">Virginia</span> and the <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania</span>, each of these vessels
being between 3,000 and 3,500 gross tonnage, and consequently
they were the largest cargo carriers afloat at that time.
During the following year (1864) three new steamers of still
larger tonnage were added to the fleet. These were named
respectively <span class="smcap">The Queen</span>, <span class="smcap">Erin</span> and <span class="smcap">Helvetia</span>. So successful
were these vessels that twelve months later (1865) two more
steamers were built for the Company, viz., the <span class="smcap">England</span> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
<span class="smcap">Denmark</span>, both of 3,723 tons gross, and these were followed in
1866 by the <span class="smcap">France</span>, a vessel of about the same tonnage.</p>

<p>A great advance in the size of the Company’s steamers was
made in 1868, when the <span class="smcap">Italy</span>, a steamer of 4,300 tons, was
placed on the line. Not only was the <span class="smcap">Italy</span> the largest transatlantic
liner at that date, but she was also the first in which
compound engines were fitted. A somewhat smaller steamship,
the <span class="smcap">Holland</span>, of 3,847 tons gross, was built in 1869.
The following year two very large and powerful vessels were
added to the fleet. These were the <span class="smcap">Egypt</span>, of 4,669 tons gross,
and the <span class="smcap">Spain</span>, of 4,512 tons; both steamers were built on the
Mersey, the former by the Liverpool Shipbuilding Co., and
the latter by Messrs. Laird, of Birkenhead.</p>

<p>The Company now possessed a sufficiently large fleet to
maintain a regular weekly service between Liverpool and New
York, sailing from Liverpool every Wednesday, and from New
York every Saturday; and a fortnightly service from London
to New York, via Havre.</p>

<p>The steamships of this line were good, roomy, comfortable
boats, with lofty ’tween decks. They carried immense cargoes
of cotton, grain, provisions, and other American produce from
the United States to Great Britain, and though they could not
compare with the Cunard or Inman liners in the elegance of
the accommodation provided for saloon passengers, yet they
were well adapted for the conveyance of emigrants, of whom
they carried large numbers. As they did not specially cater
for saloon passengers, and carried no mails, they were not
driven at the high rate of speed maintained by the premier
transatlantic steamship companies. It is true that for a time
the National Line held the “Blue Ribbon” of the Atlantic,
but this honourable position was held for a very short time
only, and the vessel by which it was gained was sold to the
Italian Government. The steamer referred to was the
<span class="smcap">America</span>, built and engined by Messrs. J. &amp; G. Thomson,
Glasgow, in 1883. Her gross tonnage was 5,528 tons, with
compound engines of 1,064 horse-power nominal. Her length
was 441 feet 8 inches; breadth, 51 feet 2 inches; and her
depth 36 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>In less than twelve months from the date of her launch, she
was purchased by the Italian Government, by whom she was
equipped as an armed cruiser, and renamed <span class="smcap">Italia</span>. Prior to
the construction of the <span class="smcap">America</span>, the Company had increased
its fleet by the addition of the steamers <span class="smcap">Greece</span> and <span class="smcap">Canada</span>.
On the 31st December, 1889, the <span class="smcap">Erin</span> sailed with seventy-two
persons on board, and disappeared without leaving a trace.</p>

<p>After trading successfully for a number of years, the National
Steamship Company got into financial difficulties. Its vessels
were dispersed; the Liverpool service to New York was
abandoned, and only that from London retained. When the
nineteenth century closed the only steamers sailing under its
flag were the <span class="smcap">America</span>, <span class="smcap">Europe</span> and <span class="smcap">Manhattan</span>. These three
steamers are built of steel, and each carries four masts. They
are all driven by triple-expansion engines, and the last-named
vessel is a twin-screw steamer. The respective measurements
are as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">America</span>, 5,158 tons gross, built and engined by Gourlay
Brothers &amp; Co., Dundee, in 1891, is 435 feet long, 46 feet
3 inches broad, and 25 feet 2 inches deep, with engines of
516 nominal horse-power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Europe</span>, 5,302 tons gross, built and engined by Palmers,
Limited, Newcastle, in 1891, is 435 feet long, 46 feet 4 inches
broad, and 25 feet 2 inches deep, with engines of 545 nominal

horse-power.</p>

<p>The National Line, like the Inman Line, has now been
absorbed by the American combine.</p>

<p>For several years prior to 1863, Mr. Stephen B. Guion, of
New York, had established a line of clipper ships between that
port and Liverpool. Finding it impossible to contend against
screw steamers in the ocean trade, he entered (in the year
named) into an arrangement to supply, through his old connections
and agents in America, the Cunard and National Companies
with steerage passengers and cargo for their steamers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
This arrangement held good until 1866, when Mr. Guion, in
co-partnery with others, formed a steamship company whose
official title was “The Liverpool and Great Western Steamship
Co.,” but which was popularly known as the Guion Line. The
first steamer of the new line was the iron screw steamer
<span class="smcap">Manhattan</span>, which sailed from Liverpool to New York in
August, 1866. This steamer was still afloat in 1903, being
then the property of Messrs. W. H. Ross &amp; Co., by whom she
was renamed the <span class="smcap">City of Lincoln</span>. The fleet of the Guion
Line was speedily sufficiently numerous to maintain a regular
weekly service from Liverpool to New York, and within six
years of the formation of the Company it possessed eight first-class
iron screw steamships, each of about 3,000 tons burthen.
They were named after the Western States of America, viz.,
<span class="smcap">Manhattan</span>, <span class="smcap">Nebraska</span>, <span class="smcap">Minnesota</span>, <span class="smcap">Colorado</span>, <span class="smcap">Idaho</span>,
<span class="smcap">Nevada</span>, <span class="smcap">Wisconsin</span>, and <span class="smcap">Wyoming</span>. In 1874 the <span class="smcap">Montana</span>, of
3,500 tons, was added to the fleet, which was further increased
in 1875 by the addition of the <span class="smcap">Dakota</span>.</p>

<p>None of the vessels named had distinguished themselves by
their extraordinary speed; but in 1879 there was built for the
Guion Line, by the Fairfield Shipbuilding Company, the
steamer <span class="smcap">Arizona</span>. She was an entirely new type of vessel.
The older ships, though differing in their models, might be
described generally as brig rigged screw steamers carrying a
single funnel amidships, and having their saloons aft. The
<span class="smcap">Arizona</span> carried four masts, of which the fore and main were
square rigged, and two funnels between the main and mizzen
masts. The saloon was situated amidships, and was superbly
furnished. The length of the <span class="smcap">Arizona</span> was 450 feet, her
breadth 45 feet, and her depth 35 feet. She sailed on her first
voyage from Liverpool to New York on the 31st May, 1879,
and is at the present date (1903) employed as a troopship by
the U.S. Government, her name having been changed to the
<span class="smcap">Hancock</span>.</p>

<p>A sister vessel to the <span class="smcap">Arizona</span> was built by the same builders
in 1881. She was larger and more powerful than the <span class="smcap">Arizona</span>,
and increased the reputation for speed which that steamer had
created. The <span class="smcap">Alaska</span> left Liverpool on her maiden voyage on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the 29th October, 1881. On the 12th September, 1882, she
sailed from New York, and completed her voyage to Queenstown
in 6 days 18 hours and 38 minutes. This rapid passage
was, however, excelled by the same Company’s steamer
<span class="smcap">Oregon</span>, which sailed from Liverpool to New York on the 6th
October, 1883, and made the passage from Queenstown to
Sandy Hook in 6 days 10 hours and 9 minutes. The <span class="smcap">Oregon</span>
was also built and engined by the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co.
She was 501 feet long, 54 feet 2 inches broad, and 38 feet deep.
Her gross tonnage was 7,375 tons; and her engines developed
13,500 horse-power, giving a speed of 18 knots per hour. Her
career was a brief but brilliant one. Built in 1883, she sank
after a collision with an American schooner on the 11th March,
in 1886.</p>

<p>These three celebrated steamers, the <span class="smcap">Alaska</span>, <span class="smcap">Arizona</span> and
<span class="smcap">Oregon</span> were popularly known as the “Greyhounds of the
Atlantic.” As has been stated, the <span class="smcap">Oregon</span> was lost after
collision, the <span class="smcap">Arizona</span> is still afloat, and the <span class="smcap">Alaska</span> was sold
in 1902 for the purpose of breaking up. After the decease of
Mr. S. B. Guion, which occurred on the 19th December, 1885,
the steamers of the fleet were gradually disposed of to various
purchasers. The firm, however, of Guion &amp; Co. is still in
existence, as passenger agents, the business being carried on by
Mr. Frank Ramsden and Mr. I. O. Roberts.</p>

<p>The Royal Atlantic Steam Navigation Company, better
known as the “Galway Line,” was established by a number of
English and Irish gentlemen, who in January, 1859, proposed
to the British Government to carry H.M. mails from Galway
to Portland, Boston, or New York, via St. John’s, Newfoundland,
or otherwise, for the sum of £3,000 on the round voyage.
They further offered “to convey telegraphic messages from the
United Kingdom to British North America and the United
States in six days, casualties excepted.” As the Atlantic cable
was not then in existence, the Government was favourably
disposed to the scheme, and on the 21st April, 1859, a contract
was entered into with the said company, based on the terms of
the proposals made to the Government.</p>

<p>On the 10th June following, the Royal Atlantic Steam Navigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Company contracted with Messrs. Palmer, of Newcastle,
for the construction of two steamships, the cost of each to be
£95,000; and five days later (15th June) they concluded a
similar contract with Messrs. Samuelson, of Hull, for two
steamships, to cost £97,000 each. As the date of the commencement
of the postal service, according to the Government contract,
was fixed for June, 1860, the contract with the builders
stipulated for delivery of the vessels within eleven months from
the date of the agreement. It was also a condition of the
contracts, that the ships were to be built according to lines,
plans, and specifications approved by the Admiralty. The four
steamships referred to were almost uniform in model, measurement
and equipment. Each measured about 2,800 tons, with
engines of about 850 nominal horse-power. Their principal
dimensions were—Length 360 feet, beam 40 feet, and depth of
hold 32 feet. Those built by Messrs. Palmer were named
<span class="smcap">Connaught</span> and <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span>, and those by Messrs. Samuelson,
<span class="smcap">Columbia</span> and <span class="smcap">Anglia</span>. A clause in the Company’s contract
with the builders specified “that each of the said vessels
when completed was, on a fair and proper trial thereof, to
accomplish a speed at the rate of 20 statute miles per hour in
smooth water, and to consume not more than 8,800 pounds of
fuel per hour.” In the case of the <span class="smcap">Connaught</span> this condition
was not complied with, for on her trial trip the Government
Inspector reported that the speed of this “vessel was about
thirteen knots.”</p>

<p>From its commencement the Company was in difficulties.
The second steamer, the <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span>, on being surveyed by the
Government Inspectors, was found to be leaky. None of the
vessels were delivered within the time agreed upon, and in
order to keep faith with the Government the Company was
compelled to charter a steamer to inaugurate the service.
They accordingly hired from the Messrs. Malcomsons, of
Waterford, one of their Liverpool and River Plate steamers,
the <span class="smcap">Parana</span>, which sailed from Galway on the 27th June, 1860,
and arrived at St. John’s in seven days thirteen and a half
hours, or one day thirteen and a half hours beyond the stipulated
time for delivering the telegraph messages at St. John’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>The second steamer to sail from Galway was the <span class="smcap">Connaught</span>,
which sailed for Boston direct on the 11th July, and was
twenty-two and a half hours over contract time in arriving at
that port. This steamer was totally lost on her second
voyage in October of the same year.</p>

<p>The third steamer of the Company sailed from Galway on
the 9th April, 1861, and returned in May following in a disabled
condition, having met with ice on the passage. She made
the slowest passage outwards of any of the fleet, having taken
ten days seven and a half hours to reach St. John’s, and
seventeen days twenty and three quarter hours to reach Boston.</p>

<p>As two of their own steamers were unavailable, the one being
lost and the other disabled, the Directors found it necessary to
take up outside steamers. They therefore chartered the
<span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span>, and purchased the <span class="smcap">Adriatic</span>, one of the latest
and most famous of the Collins Line. She appears to have
been the only vessel belonging to the Company capable of
carrying out the terms of the Government Contract. She
completed the run from Galway to St. John’s in the specified
time, six days, and to New York in one day fifteen hours and
fifteen minutes less than contract time. On her return she
made the passage from St. John’s to Galway in five days
nineteen hours and three quarters, the shortest passage on
record from port to port across the Atlantic. It is impossible
to state what would have been the result had the steamers
built for the Company been equal to the <span class="smcap">Adriatic</span>, but she was
secured too late to retrieve the fortunes of the Company.
Unable under such adverse circumstances to raise fresh capital,
the managers of the Company had no course left but to
abandon their undertaking, and they terminated their contract
in May, 1861. This unfortunate enterprise entailed a loss to
the Government of about £15,000, while it is probable that the
loss incurred by the shareholders of the Company was not less
than £150,000 during the short period of its existence.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The <span class="smcap">Orion</span> wrecked off Portpatrick, 1850.—The steamer <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>.—A
second “Grace Darling,” 1852.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">One of the most convincing proofs of the splendid management
of the several steamship companies which trade between
Liverpool and Glasgow, of the skill and honest workmanship
put into the vessels, and of the great care exercised by the
officers who navigate these ships, is the fact that for upwards
of eighty years there has been but one disaster accompanied
by loss of life on this station.</p>

<p>The disaster referred to was described at the time as “a
disaster occasioned by the most culpable carelessness.” It
was, unfortunately, attended with frightful loss of life. The
<span class="smcap">Orion</span>, a splendidly fitted and powerful steamer, sailed
from Liverpool for Glasgow, on Monday afternoon, 18th
June, 1850, with about 170 passengers in addition to a crew of
40 all told. It was an ideal summer trip; the night was fine
and clear, and the sea perfectly smooth. All went well with
the steamer and those on board until, about a quarter past one
on the Tuesday morning, the sleeping passengers were rudely
awakened by the concussion, as the ship struck violently on the
rocks, close to the Lighthouse at the entrance to Portpatrick
Harbour. The vessel, which was steaming at full speed at
the time, filled instantly, and sank in a few minutes. The
night was so tranquil that many of the passengers had slept
on deck, but the majority were asleep in the cabins below
when the catastrophe occurred. The scene of horror and
dismay which followed can be but faintly conceived. A wild
rush of crew and passengers was made to the boats. The first
boat lowered to the water was so crowded instantly with panic-stricken
passengers, that she capsized, and all who were in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
were drowned. A second boat was launched, in which some
ladies were placed, and these reached the harbour safely. One
redeeming feature in this tragic narrative is the splendid
heroism displayed by many of the gentlemen passengers. The
second boat when launched was in the first instance filled by
men, but when the officers of the ship suggested to them that
their first duty was to save the women and children, most of
the men instantly left the boat, and assisted females to occupy
the places they had surrendered, who were thus happily
preserved.</p>

<p>Shortly after this boat got away the ill-fated <span class="smcap">Orion</span> sank,
and all on board either went down with her, or were left
floating on the surface of the water, or clinging to floating
portions of the wreck.</p>

<p>The Ardrossan and Fleetwood steamship <span class="smcap">Fenella</span> passed the
scene immediately after the disaster occurred, and the Captain
at once stopped his ship, lowered his boats, and rendered
valuable assistance in saving lives. The Lighthouse keepers
and Coastguards had also observed the vessel coming too close
in shore, and, anticipating a catastrophe, had awakened the
local boatmen. Owing to this, numerous boats had instantly
put off, and these picked up a large number of those floating.
By the continued efforts of the <span class="smcap">Fenella</span>’s crew, and the Portpatrick
boatmen, about 150 persons were rescued. This
dreadful catastrophe carried mourning into many of the most
respectable families in Liverpool and Glasgow. Amongst
those who perished were Captain McNeil (brother of the Lord
Advocate), his wife and two daughters; Dr. Burns, one of the
most popular men in Glasgow, professor of Surgery at the
University, and brother to the Managing owners in Glasgow;
Miss Morris, his niece; and Master Martin, a son of one of the
Liverpool owners. The trial of the Captain, and first and
second mates of the <span class="smcap">Orion</span>, for the “culpable bereavement of
the lives of the passengers” who were lost by the wreck of
that steamer, as before narrated, took place at Edinburgh,
before the High Court of Justice, on the 29th August, 1850.
It was proved that during the second mate’s watch, the vessel
approached closer to the shore more than was usual by upwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
of a mile, and that this course was maintained notwithstanding
the warning exclamations of the experienced seamen who were
on the look out.</p>

<p>It was further proved that the Captain had come on deck
several times during the second mate’s watch, and each time
had observed both the compass, and the ship’s proximity to the
shore, which could be clearly seen, and yet did not countermand
the second mate’s instructions.</p>

<p>The charge against the first mate was withdrawn, but at the
end of the trial, which lasted two days, the Court sentenced
the Captain to be imprisoned for eighteen months, and the
second mate to be transported for seven years.</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn from this sad story to an incident connected
with the steamer <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of which the heroine was
a young Norwegian girl, who has been appropriately termed
“A second Grace Darling.” During the 25th, 26th and 27th
November, 1852, a strong gale prevailed in the North Sea.
About midnight on the last date the <span class="smcap">Neptune</span> arrived off the
Lighthouse at the entrance to Flekke Fjord, Norway. She
was bound from London to St. Petersburg, and had the pilot
flag flying at her masthead. Just at daybreak the steamer
was observed by a young girl, who immediately called up two
of the boatmen, who, however, were not apparently inclined to
respond to the call.</p>

<p>The girl, however, realizing the urgency of the appeal for a
pilot, reproached the men with being afraid of the weather, and
under the pressure of her taunts they got their boat out to go
to the assistance of the <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>, the girl accompanying them.
When they got near the ship they found that, owing to the
heavy surge, it was impossible to get close to the ship’s side.
A rope was thrown to them, and caught by the girl, who twisted
it round her waist and arm, then jumped into the sea and was
hauled on board the steamer; the two men thereupon followed
her example. This help was most welcome, and the Captain
was the more pleased to receive it owing to his cargo having
shifted. With the assistance of the Norwegians the rest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
the voyage was safely accomplished. There were eight lady
passengers on board the <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>, who made much of the
Norse “Grace Darling,” provided her with dry clothing, and
gave her a handsome donation in cash. The seamen and
firemen also contributed three pounds (£3) for the same purpose,
and on the return voyage she was put ashore at the place
where she embarked, most fortunately with a considerable
amount of cash in her possession, as her master refused to
permit her to return to his service.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">The Eastern Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., and the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span>,
steamship.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the year 1851 a steamship company was promoted in
London, under the title of the Eastern Steam Navigation
Company, Limited, for the purpose of establishing a direct
line of leviathan steamers between England and India, <em>via</em>
the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>The services of the most distinguished engineers of the
period were secured, Mr. I. K. Brunel being appointed the
consulting engineer of the company. An order was placed
with Messrs. Scott Russell &amp; Co. for the pioneer steamer,
which it was at first the intention of the company to call the
<span class="smcap">Leviathan</span>, but that name was subsequently abandoned in
favour of <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span>. She was to be propelled by paddle
wheels and a propeller. Mr. Scott Russell designed the lines,
and constructed the hull of the vessel, as well as the engines
of 1,000 h. p. nom. to drive the paddle wheels. Messrs. James
Watt &amp; Co., of Soho, designed and constructed the engines, of
1,500 h. p. nom., to drive the screw propeller. As a matter of
course, some considerable time was occupied in preparing the
plans for so gigantic a ship—one which was not only the
largest ever built up to that date, but which remained the
largest steamer built to the end of the 19th century. The
necessary plans, specifications and yard preparations were
completed during the spring of 1854, and on the 1st of May
of that year, the construction of the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> was commenced
by Mr. Scott Russell in his shipbuilding yard at
Millwall, on the north side of the Thames. She was built
with a double hull from the keel to the water line, the inner
and the outer skin being of equal thickness of iron, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>space between of 34 inches. If required for ballasting
purposes, this space could be filled with 2,500 tons of water.
The length of the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> was 675 feet, her breadth
83 feet, and her depth 60 feet. She was divided into 60 watertight
compartments, each 60 feet long. She carried six
masts—the mizzen mast of wood, and the remaining five of
hollow wrought iron. Three of these masts carried square
sails, the other three were fore and aft rigged. She had five
funnels, two of which were placed forward of the paddle
boxes and three aft. Her hull was constructed of 30,000
plates of iron, weighing 10,000 tons, and joined together by
3,000,000 rivets. “Her cylinders, the four largest in the
world ... (each) 18 feet long, 6 feet in diameter, and 28
tons weight, were successfully cast at the Engineering Works
of Messrs. Scott Russell &amp; Co., Millwall.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<br>

<p>In her equipment were included twenty large lifeboats, and
it was intended that she should carry in addition two small
steamers, each 100 feet long, to be used for landing and
embarking passengers or luggage.</p>

<p>She was designed to carry 10,000 troops or 4,000 passengers,
viz., 800 first-class, 2,000 second-class, and 800 third-class, in
addition to a crew of about 400, and she was capable of
stowing 12,000 tons of coal.</p>

<p>Although, nominally, the engines which drove the paddle
wheels were of 1,000 h. p., they were capable of working up
to 5,000 h. p., while the screw engines worked up to 6,000
h. p., or with combined paddle and screw her engines could
develop 11,000 h. p., which it was estimated would enable her
to maintain at sea a speed of 20 knots per hour, and to accomplish
the voyage between England and Australia in 30 days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is a question of much interest to determine what
amount of speed this power will impart to the vessel.
Messrs. James Watt &amp; Co.’s anticipation is that the
speed of the vessel will be about seventeen miles per
hour, and from that to eighteen miles seems to be about
the limit engineers have hitherto predicted. But we
believe that these anticipations fall very short of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the real speed will be, and which we do not hesitate to
predict, will turn out to be between twenty-four and
twenty-five miles per hour.” (“Illustrated London
News,” 23rd May, 1857).</p>
</div>

<p>On Tuesday, 3rd November, 1857, the first attempt was
made to launch the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span>. The hour named for
commencing the launching operations was 11 o’clock, and was
kept fairly punctually. The chief machinery for moving the
hull was boxed off, and nearly altogether out of sight. The
vessel’s name, <span class="smcap">Leviathan</span>, was given by Miss Hope (who
afterwards became the Duchess of Newcastle), the daughter of
the Chairman of the Great Eastern Steam Navigation
Company, and the name displayed upon a board; the change
of name from <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> to <span class="smcap">Leviathan</span> occasioning a
good deal of surprise. After the customary bottle of wine was
smashed against the vessel’s bow, a “fortissimo obligate” of
sledge hammers resounded above and around—then ceased.
The great ship moved for a few feet, then stopped. The
congregated thousands waited in suspense, when suddenly a
terrific report was heard. One of the powerful drums used in
the launch had cracked. An order had been misunderstood;
the after-winch handles were turned the wrong way; the
heavy iron handles revolved wildly, striking down the men,
fracturing their arms and legs, and with a fatal result in one
instance.</p>

<p>A second attempt was made to launch the <span class="smcap">Leviathan</span> on
Thursday, 19th November, 1857, but the efforts were even less
successful than on the first occasion, for despite all the
mechanical power brought to bear on her she would not move
an inch.</p>

<p>On Monday, 11th January, 1858, launching operations
were resumed at Millwall, and the monster ship was moved
riverwards to the extent of 20 feet. On Tuesday a further
advance was made until a little after 3 o’clock in the afternoon,
when, having moved 16 feet 10 inches aft, and 15 feet
1 inch forward, it was thought desirable to suspend operations.
At high water on the latter day the ship was water borne to
the height of 7½ feet, which had the effect of diminishing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
resistance to the extent of 4,000 tons. The yard and river
banks were crowded with spectators on the following day
(Wednesday), in the expectation that the ship would float, but
she was only moved another 2½ inches. On Thursday the
<span class="smcap">Leviathan</span> was pushed down the full extent of the ways, and
there left for the next spring tides.</p>

<p>The completion of the launch of this stupendous and
beautiful vessel took place on Sunday, 31st January, 1858,
under the most favourable circumstances, and unattended
with a single accident, the high tide lifting the vessel clear off
the ways.</p>

<p>It is incomprehensible how so eminent an engineer as
Brunel should have made such a mistake as to attempt to force
so huge a fabric broadside on into the river. The costly
experiment added £120,000 to the cost of the ship, and
practically ruined the company.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the company’s operations, the
directors were hampered by the failure of many of the shareholders
to meet the calls upon their shares when due. To
add to these difficulties, Messrs. Scott Russell &amp; Co. (the
builders of the ship), in 1855, found themselves unable to
meet their obligations, and to complete the construction of the
<span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span>.</p>

<p>At the half-yearly meeting of the company, held on the
15th February, 1856, the chairman reported that the failure
of Mr. Scott Russell would be a cause of some delay,
and of some increased cost in the completion of their vessel,
which would be undertaken by the company’s engineer, Mr.
I. K. Brunel. Twelve months later it was announced that
calls to date amounted to £606,000, of which nearly
£200,000 remained unpaid, owing to a number of other shareholders,
in addition to Mr. Scott Russell, having become insolvent.</p>

<p>The opening months of 1858 saw the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span>
successfully launched, but the Great Eastern Steam Navigation
Company had not the funds necessary for her equipment.
During the year the company was wound up by the sale and
transfer of the ship to a new company for the sum of
£160,000—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All the capital had been expended, the public refused
to advance any more money, and if the directors wished
their ship to be anything but a helpless, unfinished
carcase on the waters £300,000 more must be found to
make her ready for sea. To the exertions of Mr.
Campbell (the present chairman of the Board), and to
Mr. William Jackson (the eminent and well-known
contractor of Birkenhead), we believe is greatly owing
the pleasant result of our being at length able to
announce that the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> is ready for sea.
But one still more remarkable aid was forthcoming, and
which we could hardly believe, only that we have it on
the best authority—it was a subscription of no less than
£50,000 of the supplementary capital, in sums of £1 to
£5, by persons in the humblest ranks of life (domestic
servants, costermongers, greengrocers and labourers)—who
tendered their money avowedly without any
expectation of profit, but solely that they might hear of
the great ship, which they looked upon as the pride of
England, being fairly afloat on the deep waters. Such
a fact at once took the vessel out of the category of mere
commercial undertakings, and more than anything else
stimulated the brave men who were her projectors to
renewed exertions for her ultimate completion.”
(“Illustrated London News,” 13th August, 1859).</p>
</div>

<p>The sum of £300,000 having been subscribed for the new
undertaking, the directors had, after paying for the vessel, a
surplus of £140,000 to complete her equipment and make her
ready for sea. Her new owners took possession of her early in
1859, but it was not until September of that year that she was
sufficiently complete to make her first trial trip. While on
this trip, and when off Hastings, a shocking accident occurred,
through the explosion of one of the funnel casings, causing
the death of six men, injuring several others, and virtually
wrecking the grand saloon. As no further damage was done
to the hull or machinery, she proceeded to Portland, and the
necessary repairs having been completed at an outlay of
£5,000, she resumed her voyage to Holyhead on the 8th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
October. She started on her return trial trip from Holyhead
to Southampton on the 2nd November, 1859, where she
remained until the 17th June, 1860.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> was advertised to leave Southampton
on her first voyage to New York on Saturday, 16th June,
1860, but, in consequence of bad weather on that date, the
sailing was postponed until the following morning. She
carried only 36 passengers, including several ladies, on this
trip. The voyage across the Atlantic occupied eleven days.
The greatest speed attained was 14½ knots per hour, and the
greatest distance run by her in any one day was 333 miles.
Immense crowds assembled to witness her arrival in New
York Harbour, and she was welcomed with great enthusiasm.
She passed the battery at 4-30 p.m. on the 28th June, 1860.</p>

<p>The promoters of the Great Eastern Steam Navigation
Company were very sanguine that the Government would
frequently employ their vessel for the conveyance of troops, of
which they estimated she could carry ten thousand. The
Government very wisely never risked so great a body of men
in one vessel.</p>

<p>The only occasion on which the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> was made
use of as a troopship was during the threatened rupture
between England and the Federal Government of America, in
connection with the “Trent Affair.” She made her first
entry into the port of Liverpool on the 4th June, having made
the passage from New York in 9 days 11 hours. She had on
board 212 passengers and a large cargo. On Thursday, 27th
June, 1861, she sailed out of the Mersey on a voyage to
Quebec, with troops to reinforce the Canadian garrisons. The
day was cloudless, there was brilliant sunshine, and the piers
and dock walls for five miles, as well as the landing-stages,
were lined with spectators, who, as the great ship passed them,
responded most heartily to the cheers raised by the soldiers
who thronged the upper deck and the lower portions of the
rigging.</p>

<p>As she passed the landing-stages she fired salutes, and also
on passing the Rock Battery. There were on board the
<span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span>, not 10,000 troops as her promoters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
anticipated, but 2,125 men of all ranks, accompanied by 159
wives and 244 children of the soldiers. There were also about
40 civilian passengers in the saloon.</p>

<p>She left Quebec on her return voyage on the 6th August,
arriving in Liverpool on the 15th idem, and resumed her
sailings to New York.</p>

<p>She sailed from Liverpool for New York on the 10th
September, under the command of Captain Walker, having on
board 175 cabin and 193 steerage passengers. On the
following Thursday she encountered a heavy gale, during
which, when about 280 miles westward of Cape Clear, her
steering apparatus became deranged and broken, and five of
her lifeboats were carried away. For two days and nights she
lay helpless, exposed to a terrific sea. Her internal fittings
were in consequence seriously damaged, and her passengers
greatly alarmed for their safety. The Captain decided to
abandon the voyage and put back to Queenstown, arriving in
the harbour on the Tuesday following. The passengers, when
once more on <em>terra firma</em>, relieved their feelings by publishing
some very angry letters in the Press, in which they reflected
very severely on the managers of the company, but gave
unqualified praise to Captain Walker for the manner in which
he had handled the great ship in her disabled state.</p>

<p>The laying of submarine cables, commenced in 1865, offered
employment for which the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> was specially suitable,
and in which she was constantly engaged for a period of
ten years.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon on the 30th June, 1866, the <span class="smcap">Great
Eastern</span> left the Medway, having on board the second
Atlantic cable. She was convoyed by H.M.S. <span class="smcap">Adder</span> as far as
the Nore. As she steamed past Garrison Point she was loudly
cheered by a vast concourse of people who had gathered there.
She proceeded direct to Berehaven, in the extreme South-West
of Ireland, which was to be her starting point for laying
the submarine cable. Four weeks later, or to be exact, about
5 o’clock (English time) on the 27th July, this great task was
successfully accomplished. One of the earliest messages
transmitted by the cable was the following from H.M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Queen Victoria to the President of the United States of
America:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Queen congratulates the President on the
successful completion of an undertaking which she
hopes may serve as an additional bond of union between
the United States and England.”</p>
</div>

<p>President Johnson suitably acknowledged the Royal
despatch, and reciprocated the good wishes contained in it.
[A most interesting diary of the Atlantic Telegraph
Expedition is published in the Annual Register for 1866.]</p>

<p>In 1867 her cable-laying services were interrupted by a
charter to a French company, who employed her between
Brest and New York, carrying passengers to and from the
great French Exhibition. For this service she was fitted with
new boilers for the screw engines, and her saloons were altered
and redecorated.</p>

<p>After the completion of her charter with the French company,
she was taken up by the Telegraphic Construction and
Maintenance Company, in whose service she remained for
seven years. During this period she succeeded in laying the
cable between Brest and Duckburgh, near Boston, Mass., in
1868; between Aden and Bombay in 1870; between Valentia
and Heart’s Content, in 1873 and 1874; completing her
charter to the Telegraphic Construction Company in July,
1875. The amount received for charter was at the rate of
£20,000 per annum, nett form.</p>

<p>The last years of this noble vessel were ignominious. She
was chartered in 1886 by “Lewis’s,” who used her for a
couple of years as a huge floating advertisement on the
Mersey. She afterwards went to several Ports as a “show”
ship, and finally returned to the Mersey to be broken up on
the 20th November, 1888. Her owners at this time were
probably the only persons who ever realized a handsome profit
out of her during her varied career. The following is a list of
the prices obtained at the sale of the various parts of the hull
and equipment:—</p>

<p>Eleven-ton Trotman’s anchor, 33 guineas, in addition to a
number of other anchors, which realized £3 to £7 15s. per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
ton; oak lifeboat, 2 guineas; cutter, 30s.; iron masts, £9 to
£17 10s. each; copper steam piping, £2,960; gun metal,
£6,400; scrap yellow brass, £1,760; sheet lead, £367 10s.;
lead piping, £367 10s.; iron plates forming the hull, £12,600;
iron beams, £2 13s. per ton; scrap rivets, £2 6s. per ton;
boiler tubes, £49 7s. 6d.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>So ended the career of the most celebrated ship of the 19th
century.</p><br>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">The first voyage by a steamer ever made between Great
Britain and Australia was in 1831 by the <span class="smcap">Sophia Jane</span>, a
small vessel of 256 tons burthen and 50 h.p. (see reference to
this vessel in the History of the Cork Steamship Co., Limited).</p>

<p>Twenty-one years later the owners of the <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>,
the Liverpool and Australian Steam Navigation Co. (Messrs.
Gibbs, Bright &amp; Co., Managers), induced by the great rush of
emigrants to the newly discovered Australian goldfields,
decided to supplement their “Eagle” Line of Packets by the
addition of screw steamers and issued an advertisement as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Steam from Liverpool to Australia, forming part of the
‘Eagle’ Line of Packets.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>, S.S., 3,500 tons and 500 h.p., B.
R. Matthews, E.N., Commander, will be despatched for
Melbourne and Sydney, N.S.W., calling at the Cape
of Good Hope for coals, water and fresh provisions, on
Saturday, 21st August, 1852, at 1 p.m. This magnificent
ship, fitted up with every possible convenience,
has just performed her trial voyage to New York in the
most satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>“Fares:—After Saloon, to Melbourne, 70 guineas and
upwards. Five guineas extra to Sydney, N.S.W.</p>

<p>“To Cape of Good Hope, 50 guineas.</p>

<p>“Loading Berth, Wellington Dock.</p>

<p>“Apply to Gibbs, Bright &amp; Co., Liverpool.”</p>
</div>

<p>The result must have been exceedingly gratifying to the
owners, as the <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> sailed on this her first voyage to
the Antipodes with upwards of 600 passengers. Ten days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
later the ship <span class="smcap">Albatross</span> arrived with the first importation into
Liverpool of gold from Australia, being 20,000 ozs. consigned
to Messrs. Gibbs, Bright &amp; Co. On the 23rd November
following, her sister ship, the <span class="smcap">Eagle</span>, arrived in the Thames
with 150,000 ounces of gold valued at £600,000. The ship
<span class="smcap">Dido</span> was expected to arrive in a few days, having on board ten
and a half tons of the precious metal, of the enormous value
of £1,120,000.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> arrived at Melbourne on the 10th
November, 1852, after a splendid run from the Cape of Good
Hope of 24 days, her average speed having been 284 miles
per day. Her engines behaved splendidly, and there was no
occasion to stop them during the whole of the time. One
death occurred on board, that of a Chinaman who embarked
at St. Helena.</p>

<p>Owing to the difficulty of obtaining labour to discharge and
load the ship at Melbourne, she was detained at that port for
three months, and sailed on her return voyage about the end
of January, 1853. On her arrival at Cape Town she re-filled
her bunkers from the <span class="smcap">Rebecca</span>, a ship which had been sent
from Liverpool with a cargo of coal for that purpose, and
resumed her voyage northwards on the 20th February.</p>

<p>She continued to trade with varying success between Liverpool
and Australia as an auxiliary steamer for 40 years, and
in 1882 was sold to Messrs. Anthony Gibbs, Sons &amp; Co., who
took out her engines and converted her into a sailing ship.
Originally she carried six masts, two of which had been taken
out of her when she was placed on the Anglo-Australian
station, and when Messrs. Anthony Gibbs, Sons &amp; Co. purchased
her they took out a third mast and rigged her as a full-rigged
sailing ship. In order to strengthen her hull, they also, at a
very great expense, completely sheathed her frame with wood,
in October, 1882. She sailed on her last voyage from Liverpool
in 1886, and put into the Falkland Islands so battered
with her battle with wind and waves that she was abandoned
to the Underwriters as a constructive total loss. She was sold
by the latter to the Falkland Islands Co., who used her as a
coal hulk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>One of her earliest competitors was an American steamer
named the <span class="smcap">Golden Age</span>. She was the property of the New
York and Australian Steam Navigation Co., and was intended
to ply between Australia and Panama, and eventually to
extend the service to San Francisco. This splendid vessel
excited great interest in Liverpool, at which port she lay for
about two months prior to sailing for Melbourne.</p>

<p>She was very similar in outward appearance to the Collins
steamships, being barque rigged with a straight stem, and
having her paddle boxes situated very far aft. Her dimensions
were as follows: length 285 feet, beam 43 feet 6 inches,
and depth 32 feet; 2864 tons register. She had a beam engine
of somewhat peculiar construction, with a cylinder of 85 inches
diameter, and 12 feet stroke. The boilers constituted the
chief peculiarity; they were each 40 feet long, and fitted with
furnaces at each end, the smoke funnel ascending from the
centre. By this arrangement it was claimed that economy
both in space and fuel was gained. The hull of the ship was
built by Mr. W. H. Brown, New York. The lower frames
were of live oak, and the top frames of locust and cedar. The
entire hull was double diagonally braced with iron bars, five
inches wide, by three quarters of an inch thick and four feet
apart.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Golden Age</span> had accommodation for 1200 passengers
of all classes, the steerage being fitted up for 600. There were
three saloons, one above the other, two of which were panelled
in rose, satin, and zebra woods; with crimson and gold plush
and rich hangings, and adorned with mirrors. In the upper
saloon the same general arrangement prevailed, except that
instead of satinwood panelling, the sides were finished in white
and gold. In this saloon were two “family rooms,” one
finished in gold, the other in blue. A brief reference to this
steamer is made in the “Annals of Liverpool” (Gore’s Directory),
in which it is stated: “The <span class="smcap">Golden Age</span>(s.) sailed from
Liverpool, 5th December, 1853, and arrived at Melbourne in
47 days steaming time.”</p>

<p>On the 31st July, 1855, there was launched at Sandycroft,
on the River Dee, a large clipper ship fitted with auxiliary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
steam power. She was built to the order of the Liverpool and
Australian Steam Navigation Co., the owners of the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>. Her owners were of opinion that steamers
relying entirely upon their engines, could not be worked so
economically as vessels with auxiliary steam power, and sailing
vessels trusting only to their sails could not be relied upon to
make their passages with regularity and despatch, consequently
they determined to combine the two motive powers
and give their vessel the benefit of both.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Charter</span>, the name given to the new ship, was
designed and built by Mr. Paterson, the builder of the <span class="smcap">Great
Britain</span>. She was 235 feet in length over all, 41 feet 6 inches
beam, and 26 feet 6 inches depth of hold; 2720 tons burden;
could spread 15,000 square feet of canvas; and had a pair of
direct acting trunk engines of 200 h.p. nominal, constructed by
Messrs. Penn, of Greenwich, for working an auxiliary screw,
so arranged that when not wanted it could be completely
lifted out of the water, and even (if necessary) placed on deck.
She had excellent accommodation for passengers. Her chief
saloon was 100 feet long and beautifully fitted up; and the
ladies’ cabin, with its large poop windows, and elegant furniture,
was admirably adapted for its purpose. There were two large
bath rooms for the use of the after saloon passengers, and one
three times as large as either of these two for the use of the
’tween deck passengers. She had seven watertight compartments
and tanks capable of holding 64,000 gallons of water.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Charter</span>, independently of her steam power, was
a full-rigged ship, and was the first English vessel to adopt the
American plan of double topsails on each mast. On her trial
trips she averaged a speed of nine knots per hour with her
propeller; and under canvas only, with a light N.N.E. wind,
made fourteen knots per hour.</p>

<p>She was well armed, carrying eight guns—four 18 pounders
and four 24 pounders; besides a large swivel gun on the
forecastle, and a good number of Minié rifles for the saloon.</p>

<p>She left Liverpool on her maiden voyage to Melbourne on
the 16th April, 1856, and accomplished the passage in 59 days.
She had but a short career, for on the 26th October, 1859, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
noble ship was totally wrecked on the coast of Anglesea. She
had almost reached her home port, inward bound from
Australia under the command of Captain Taylor, and having
on board about 500 persons including passengers and crew,
and a valuable cargo, including gold to the amount of £400,000.
She had called at Queenstown, where thirteen of her passengers
disembarked. On her passage up channel she was caught
in a terrific northerly gale, which, driving the current in the
large bay between the Ormes Head and Point Lynas, swept
the vessel from her course and drove her upon the rock-bound
coast off Moelfra Head, Red Wharf Bay. She struck during
the night when no assistance from the shore could be obtained.
From 30 to 35 persons only were saved out of the 500 on board,
and these mainly through the heroic efforts of Joseph Rodgers,
who swam ashore with a line round his body. In recognition
of his devoted courage, this intrepid seaman was presented
with a gold medal and £5 by the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution at a meeting held at the Sailors’ Home, Liverpool,
on the 16th November, 1859, on which occasion the Board of
Trade also presented him with a silver medal and £10.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">The treaty ports of the Yang-tse were for the first time
opened to the ships of the “barbarian nations of the West”
in February, 1860.</p>

<p>The first foreign merchant vessel to load a cargo at
Shanghai for Hankow was the auxiliary screw steamer
<span class="smcap">Scotland</span>, belonging to the late W. S. Lindsay, the well-known
author of the “History of Merchant Shipping.” She
was a vessel of about 1,100 tons gross register, and was commanded
by Captain A. D. Dundas, R.N. She sailed from
Shanghai with a full cargo in June, 1860, her draft being 17
feet. She was subsequently sold to the Prince of Satsuma,
the same purchaser having previously, in 1861, purchased her
sister ship, the <span class="smcap">England</span>, from Messrs. W. S. Lindsay &amp; Co.</p>

<p>It was not until 1863 that any English steamer loaded a
cargo direct from Hankow for Great Britain. The third
vessel to sail was the auxiliary screw steamship <span class="smcap">Robert
Lowe</span>, also belonging to Messrs. Lindsay. She was a vessel of
1,250 tons gross, with engines of only 80 nominal horse power.
Her average speed between Shanghai and Hankow, a distance
of 608 miles, was 60 miles per day, but one day was lost in
changing her propeller, and she anchored every night. She
sailed from Shanghai on the 8th May, 1863, and came to an
anchor off Hankow on the 18th idem. On the 10th June her
cargo arrived alongside, and on the 23rd June she sailed for
Shanghai and London. She traversed the distance between
Hankow and Shanghai in 57 hours, the current being with
her. Her cargo for London consisted of 9,568 chests, 234
half-chests, and 2,064 boxes of tea; 535 bales of cotton and
192 packages of sundries. Her freight amounted to the
respectable sum of £10,315, in addition to which she earned
£480 passage money.</p>

<p>In 1866 Mr. Alfred Holt, of Liverpool, started a line of
steamers to trade between England and China, <em>via</em> the Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
of Good Hope. Mr. Holt was a practical engineer. Having
served his apprenticeship, he was appointed inspecting
engineer to several steamship companies, and about 1850 commenced
as steamship owner with a small coasting steamer, the
<span class="smcap">Alpha</span>. This steamer was succeeded by the <span class="smcap">Cleator</span> and
<span class="smcap">Dumbarton Youth</span>, sailing between Liverpool, Cumberland
Ports, and the Bristol Channel.</p>

<p>Upon the outbreak of the Crimean War, Mr. Holt secured
several remunerative charters from the Government, and in
1855 he inaugurated the first line of steamers between Liverpool
and the West Indies. His first steamer in this trade was
only 535 tons burden, but she was so well supported that in a
short time a monthly line of steamers of larger capacity and
greater power was established.</p>

<p>In 1863 Messrs. Leech, Harrison and Forwood, and Messrs.
Imrie and Tomlinson, entered into the same trade, and it was
considered desirable to form a public company to amalgamate
these three undertakings. A company, under the title of the
West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Limited,
was consequently formed for this purpose, with a capital of
£1,250,000, which was at once subscribed.</p>

<p>Mr. Holt now directed his energies to the Far East, and in
1865 despatched his first vessels in the China service, the
<span class="smcap">Agamemnon</span>, <span class="smcap">Ajax</span> and <span class="smcap">Achilles</span>. These were the first
steamers to apply the principle of compound engines to long
over-sea voyages. These engines were in use in the ships of
the Pacific Steam Navigation Company prior to this, but only
in those steamers employed on the Pacific coast. The performances
of the Holt steamers had been hitherto considered
impossible, and even now in the twentieth century would be
considered remarkable with boats of a similar size. Starting
from Liverpool, they steamed down the South Atlantic,
rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and so on to Mauritius, a
distance of 8,500 miles without stopping. From thence they
proceeded to Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>

<p>These three pioneers of the Anglo-China trade were each
of 2,270 tons gross and 1,550 tons net register, with engines
of 300 nominal horse power, and their principal dimensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
were—length, 309 feet; beam, 38½ feet; depth of hold to spar
deck, 28½ feet. On July 16th, 1869, one of them (the
<span class="smcap">Achilles</span>) sailed from Foochow for London <em>via</em> the Cape of
Good Hope, and arrived on the 16th September, having been
under steam 58 days 9 hours, during which time she travelled
13,552 miles, maintaining an average speed of nearly 9¾ knots
throughout the whole voyage. This was one of the last
voyages made by the Holt steamers round the Cape, as two
months after the arrival of the <span class="smcap">Achilles</span> at London the Suez
Canal was formally opened for the merchant steamers of all
countries, and from that date all the steamers of this company
have passed through that waterway on their voyages to and
from China.</p>

<p>The earlier steamers of the fleet were square-rigged on the
fore and main masts, a good rig when it was desired to take
advantage of the favourable trade winds and monsoons, which
can always be depended upon for a voyage round the Cape,
but found to be unsuitable when the route was altered to the
Suez Canal. The square sails of the three steamers named
were, therefore, removed, and the subsequent steamers have
been constructed with pole masts only.</p>

<p>Although the fleet is styled the Ocean Steamship Company,
it is popularly known as the Holt, or “Blue Funnel” Line, and
has only recently been formed into a limited company.</p>

<p>The Holt Line steamers do not carry passengers between
Great Britain and China, but they are great favourites with
the Moslem pilgrims, of whom they carry large numbers on
their journeys to and from Mecca.</p>

<p>About 1891 the Ocean Steamship Company established a
monthly service of mail and passenger steamers between
Singapore and West Australian Ports, and in 1901 a direct
service of steamers from Glasgow to Australian Ports was
opened by the despatch of the steamer <span class="smcap">Orestes</span>.</p>

<p>A controlling interest in the China Mutual Steam Navigation
Company, Limited, was purchased by, and the fleet of
that company transferred to, the Holt Company on the 1st
July, 1902, with which addition to the “Blue Funnel” fleet
extended operations were undertaken.</p><br>

</figure>

<p class="no-indent">Decidedly the most dramatic incident ever recorded in the
annals of steam navigation was the theft of the steamer <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>
and the piratical seizure and sale of her cargo of coffee.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> was a screw steamer measuring 170 feet 9 inches
in length, 23 feet 2 inches beam, and 12 feet 7 inches depth;
builders’ measurement 439 tons, with a probable carrying
capacity of 400 tons deadweight cargo, in addition to coal in
bunkers. She had compound engines of 90 h.p. nominal, and
her reputed speed was 12 knots per hour. She was built on the
Clyde in 1871, by the well-known firm of J. &amp; G. Thomson, for
Messrs. G. &amp; J. Burns, of Glasgow, from whom the Highland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Railway Co. purchased her for their mail and passenger service,
and she held a Board of Trade certificate for 200 passengers.</p>

<p>The conspirators who succeeded in stealing this vessel, laid
their plans with great care and attention to details, and carried
them out with marvellous audacity. One of them took an office
in Gracechurch Street, London, and obtained a supply of
printed stationery, describing himself as “Henderson &amp; Co.,
Ship Brokers, &amp;c.” He also opened an account with the ...
Bank, in the name of “Smith,” taking care until his plans were
perfected to keep a respectable balance to his credit.</p>

<p>Early in October, 1880, the plot had ripened, and one of the
gang, representing himself to be “Mr. Walker, purser of the
<span class="smcap">Ferret s.s.</span>,” called at the office of Douglas &amp; Co., Union Street,
a leading ship-chandler’s firm in Glasgow, and ordered a large
quantity of expensive ship-stores. The stores were for the
account of Mr. Smith, who was referred to as a relative of Mr.
W. H. Smith, late First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Naturally references were required and were freely given.
Mr. Smith had chartered from the Highland Railway Co. the
steamer <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> for a six months’ cruise in the Mediterranean,
his wife having been ordered by her doctor to take a long sea
voyage. The <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> was then in J. &amp; G. Thomson’s yard,
being overhauled preparatory to the cruise. Both of these
firms could be referred to, as well as Mr. Smith’s bankers, and
Messrs. Henderson &amp; Co., Ship Brokers, Gracechurch Street,
London. The bankers were written to, and replied that Mr.
Smith had an account with their bank. Henderson &amp; Co. were
also applied to, and of course gave a very favourable account
of Smith.</p>

<p>The merchants being satisfied with the result of their
enquiries, supplied the stores, which included an excellent
selection of first-class wines specially brought from London.
The account, which amounted to £1,490, was presented to
Walker, who gave a bill at three months endorsed by Smith. It
is to be presumed that the first-half month’s charter was paid as
customary in cash in advance, because the conspirators having
got possession of the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> were in no violent hurry to get
her out of British waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>About the 20th October, William Griffin joined the steamer
at Greenock as chief engineer. Although Griffin was not
placed on trial, yet it is to be noted that he had a prior
acquaintance with Walker, who had introduced him to Smith.
It is also undeniable that without the assistance of Griffin and
the ship’s carpenter, the alterations which were made in the
steamer could not have been effected.</p>

<p>From Greenock, the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> sailed in charge of a crew of
“runners” to Cardiff, Robert Wright, alias Carlyon (a confederate)
being master, and Walker, alias Wallace, acting as purser.
The steamer arrived at Cardiff on the 22nd October and
remained there for three days, taking in a cargo of coals for
ship’s use. The coals, of course, being paid for by valueless
bills on London. At Cardiff the “runners” were discharged
and a fresh crew, strangers to the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>, were shipped. Smith
(otherwise Henderson) also embarked at Cardiff, accompanied
by “Mrs. Smith.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> sailed from Cardiff on the 25th October and put
into Milford Haven, probably from stress of weather, where she
remained for about a week. She left Milford on the 1st
November, ostensibly for Marseilles. In pursuance of this
report, she passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on the
morning of the 11th of the same month, and showing her
number, requested to be reported.</p>

<p>Having steamed out of sight of the signalling station, the
crew were set to work to change the colour of the funnel from
white to black, and of the boats (with the exception of two)
from blue to white, and at night, with her lights screened, the
<span class="smcap">Ferret</span> returned westwards through the straits. While passing
through, the two boats that had not been altered, some empty
casks, several life-belts, and other articles, all having the
steamer’s name painted on them, were thrown overboard, for
the purpose of making it appear that the vessel had foundered.
So evident did this seem that as a matter of fact the underwriters
paid the Highland Railway Co. their claim for the total
loss of the steamer.</p>

<p>That same night all the crew were sent aft to the saloon,
where Smith made a speech to them, in which he stated that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
was a political refugee from the United States; that he had
purchased the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> to use partly as a yacht, and partly for
trading; that after he had traded for some time he would sell
the boat, and make it worth their while to keep his secret; but
on the other hand, if any of them disclosed anything they saw
or heard on board, he would blow their brains out. The crew,
when arrested, alleged that it was the fear of this threat which
prevented them giving information, when in port, of what they
knew to be suspicious actions.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p1400_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Ferret s.s.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Avoiding the Canary Islands, presumably as being too much
frequented by British shipping, the conspirators kept away to
the southward until they reached St. Vincent, C.V. Entering
the harbour, they anchored there for several days, during which
they took in fresh water, and a supply of pigs, poultry, fruit
and vegetables, paying for them in their usual manner by
means of worthless bills.</p>

<p>The “Times” (23rd June, 1881) Sydney correspondent states
that after leaving St. Vincent the vessel’s name was altered to
the <span class="smcap">Benton</span>. But this seems most improbable, as it would be
apparent that the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> did not founder in the Mediterranean,
and further it would have left a clue by which she
could easily have been traced. The truth probably is, that the
alteration was made immediately she got clear of the Straits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Gibraltar. Be this as it may, the <span class="smcap">Benton</span> arrived at Santos
on the 26th December.</p>

<p>At Santos, Smith went on shore and lost no time in opening
negotiations with the local shipping agents, to whom he stated
that the <span class="smcap">Benton</span> was from Cape Town in ballast, bound for
England. The negotiations resulted in the shipment of 3,992
bags of coffee, consigned to various consignees at Marseilles.
Having obtained this cargo, the <span class="smcap">Benton</span> sailed from Santos on
the 11th January, 1881, but instead of proceeding to Marseilles
she steamed direct to Cape Town.</p>

<p>While the <span class="smcap">Benton</span> was steaming across the South Atlantic,
the Glasgow holders of the bill for £1,490 received some information
which made them uneasy, and on presentation of the
bill when due, it was dishonoured. The account was closed,
the balance had been withdrawn, and the acceptor’s whereabouts
were unknown. The holders then applied to Henderson
and Co., but the letter was returned—addressees “gone, no
address.” They then wrote to the Highland Railway Co., and
received a reply from the Secretary to the effect that the Highland
Railway Co. had already done all in their power to trace
the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>, in their own interests, having received no charter
money from the charterers since the vessel sailed from the
Clyde. They had been in communication with Lloyd’s and the
Board of Trade, and through British Consuls and Lloyd’s
agents, enquiries had been made all over the world. About ten
days before the receipt of the merchants’ letter the Highland
Railway Co. had heard that the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> had arrived at Malta,
but on cabling there had received a reply denying the report.
They had cabled a second time, ordering the vessel to be seized
at Malta in the event of her putting in there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <span class="smcap">Benton</span> was nearing Cape Town, laden with
coffee shipped at Santos. During the voyage further changes
had been effected in the appearance of the vessel, and the name
<span class="smcap">India</span> was substituted for <span class="smcap">Benton</span>. The original name
(<span class="smcap">Ferret</span>) had previously been filed off the ship’s bell, and now,
as a further precaution the ship’s number on the main hatch
combings was altered to 77,942. The <span class="smcap">India</span> put into Cape Town
on the 29th January, and at once began to discharge her cargo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>The conspirators had provided themselves with a printing
press, and had all necessaries on board, as well as Revenue
Stamps of various nations, by which they were able to manufacture
the vouchers and documents necessary to the success of
their frauds. At Cape Town, Smith produced an invoice with
a printed heading, purporting to be an invoice for 3,992 bags
coffee sold by coffee planters at La Guayra (a small port in
Venezuela) to C. S. Henderson &amp; Co., and with it a receipt for
the amount duly stamped. He succeeded in selling the cargo,
and realised by the sale of it about £11,000. He had to accept
in part payment bills to the extent of £8,000, drawn on the
Standard Bank, Clement’s Lane, London, payable nine months
after date. It is satisfactory to know that the frauds were
discovered before the bills matured, and payment of them was
stopped. After the discharge of the cargo, Smith tried to sell
the steamer, but not succeeding in his attempt, he shipped a
quantity of coal, and sailed on the 14th February for the
Mauritius. The conspirators arrived at Mauritius on the 1st
March, but did not succeed in getting any plunder there, and
so they “cleared out for Guam.”</p>

<p>The next port they entered was Port Albany in Western
Australia, from whence they steamed direct to Melbourne.
Here Wright and Walker offered the steamer for sale, but
received no offers. While in Melbourne, several circumstances
made the Customs officers and the Harbour Police suspect that
there was something wrong about the vessel. It was observed
that the fires were always banked so that steam could be got up
at the shortest notice. Captain Wright never left the steamer,
and none of the crew (except Walker, the purser) were ever
allowed “shore leave.” The Customs authorities instructed
one of their officers to make a special investigation of the
matter, and he reported that there was no steamer of the
tonnage given registered at Lloyd’s in the name of <span class="smcap">India</span>, but
that the particulars of tonnage and dimensions corresponded
with the register of the missing steamer <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="p1430_ill" style="max-width: 42.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p1430_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent">The Arrest.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Noting all these suspicious circumstances the Customs
authorities determined on prompt action. Requisitioning two
crews of the Water Police, as it was feared there might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
violent opposition on the part of the steamer’s crew, the Commissioner
of Customs, on the 27th April, seized the vessel.
Fortunately their anticipations as to resistance were not
realised, the crew surrendering without opposition. Although
the authorities had been extremely cautious in their enquiries,
it is evident that the conspirators became aware of what was
being done, for when the steamer was seized, Smith, “Mrs.
Smith,” and Captain Wright had fled. The previous day Smith
and Mrs. Smith removed from their cabin a number of articles,
and amongst them two heavy iron-bound boxes which were
never traced. Smith succeeded in getting away from Melbourne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
to a distant township, but was arrested. Mrs. Smith,
who had disappeared for a time, when she heard of his arrest
reappeared and visited him in prison. The object of her visit
may be surmised from the fact that shortly after her visit
Smith tried to escape by filing through one of the bars of his
prison window.</p>

<p>Captain Wright had found a retreat in a Melbourne sailors’
lodging-house, but having got drunk and quarrelled with his
landlady, he was thrown out, and arrested for being drunk and
disorderly. When the charge was being booked at the police
station, he was recognised as the missing master of the steamer,
for whom the police were searching.</p>

<p>Confirmation of the suspicions which induced the Commissioner
of Customs to seize the steamer was speedily obtained.
Traces of fraud were quickly discovered on the ship’s hull and
appointments, and in the ship’s books and papers—some of the
latter being found in very unusual places of deposit. Between
the leaves of the log-book a seaman’s “advance note” was
found with the name of the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> on it. There was also
found a MSS. cypher code, by means of which communication
might be made between those in the vessel and others on shore.
It also serves to show the unscrupulous character of the
criminals and the extreme length to which they were prepared
to go. One or two quotations will illustrate the truth of this
assertion:—</p>

<p>“Accept charter referred to and lose vessel before you arrive
in port. Don’t fail.”</p>

<p>“Get out of port the best way you can, but sink the ship,
before you allow them to stop her.”</p>

<p>“Destroy all papers, &amp;c., and sink ship if possible, or burn
her, and get away. Make best of your way over here.”</p>

<p>“Things going wrong. Mate not to be trusted; shall get
rid of him.”</p>

<p>“Things going wrong with some of the crew; must get rid
of them.”</p>

<p>“Things going wrong with the whole of the crew; must get
rid of them.”</p>

<p>“Lost vessel; landed here to day; all hands forward lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“Game is all up; all discovered; destroy or hide everything,
and make yourself scarce; communicate with me through the
arranged channel.”</p>

<p>Among the papers seized was a card of a Dr. Bonefin. Now
a swindler of this name—not a common one—shortly before the
arrival of the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>, was convicted for obtaining goods under
false pretences from a number of Melbourne jewellers, and was
sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Pentridge Gaol. In
the cypher code referred to Melbourne figures as 51, so that it
is extremely probable that Bonefin was one of the conspirators
on shore.</p>

<p>A Cabinet Meeting of the Victorian Government was held
on the 9th May, and on the following morning the opinion of
the Attorney-General was published as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Government of Victoria seized the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>, which
entered this port (Melbourne) as the <span class="smcap">India</span>, in the
interests of the rightful owners, domiciled apparently in
Great Britain. At the present time no one in Victoria
is in a position to show this Government such a title to
the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> as would clear the Government from possible
liability. It appears to me that the Hon. the Commissioner
of Trade and Customs should hold the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>
till proper papers are produced in Melbourne by a legally
authorised agent of the actual owners, whose title should
be clearly proved by the needful papers from England.
This being done, and delivery charges paid, the ship
should be delivered. If it is deemed desirable to
expedite delivery of the ship, this Government is entitled
to require that the Board of Trade of London should
give a certificate as to the owners. Such certificate,
along with an indemnity to pay all costs, and an
indemnity by the owners, should be deposited with the
Agent-General for Victoria, London, who should telegraph
any instructions the owners may wish to give as to
the way they desire the ship to be dealt with, and this
Government should then act accordingly. At the same
time it would be well to learn whether the Imperial
Government wished to take proceedings against any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the offenders, and if so, what course it intended to take.
All necessary documents and evidence should be
transmitted without delay. The master, also the person
who represents himself as the owner, and another person
are charged here with forging the register of the ship,
that offence having been committed with a view to a
fraudulent sale.”</p>
</div>

<p>Eventually the three criminals arrested, viz.:—Smith (alias
Henderson, alias Benard), Wright (alias Carlyon) and Walker
(alias Wallace), were indicted on three counts:—</p>

<p>1st. Conspiracy to defraud the owners of the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>, the
Highland Railway Co.</p>

<p>2nd. Conspiracy to defraud intending purchasers of the
<span class="smcap">Ferret</span> in Melbourne; and</p>

<p>3rd. Conspiracy to deceive the Commissioner of Trade and
Customs, by entering the vessel in a false name, and to obtain
a certificate of sale under which the vessel could have been sold
in that port.</p>

<p>They were all acquitted on the first count, but convicted on
the second and third. Smith and Walker were each sentenced
to seven years’ penal servitude, and Wright to three and a half
years. This result is most remarkable. No mention is made
of the frauds perpetrated at Glasgow, Cardiff and St. Vincent,
C.V.; nor of the steps taken (if any) to secure the confederates
on shore.</p>

<p>As for the unfortunate crew, who had received no wages, they
obtained a temporary refuge in the Melbourne Sailors’ Home.
The after history of the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span> is briefly told. She was purchased
in 1885 by the Adelaide Steamship Company, Currie
Street, Adelaide, South Australia, and is at the present date
employed by that company in the Australian coasting service.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">Following the example of the Imperial Government the
Government of Canada advertised in June, 1852, for tenders
for the conveyance of mails between the United Kingdom and
Quebec and Montreal in summer, and between the United Kingdom
and Portland, Maine, in winter. The contract was secured
by Messrs. McKean, McLarty and Lamont, of Liverpool, who
formed a company, and despatched their first steamer, the
<span class="smcap">Genova</span>, a small vessel of 500 tons register, in the spring of
1853. The sailings were continued, but with no great
regularity, for about eighteen months. In addition to the
steamer named, the <span class="smcap">Cleopatra</span>, of 1467 tons, the <span class="smcap">Ottawa</span>,
and two chartered steamers, one the <span class="smcap">Charity</span>, built for the
African Steamship Co., and the other the <span class="smcap">Canadian</span>, chartered
from Messrs. Allan Brothers, were engaged in the service.
On the outbreak of the Crimean War the <span class="smcap">Ottawa</span> and <span class="smcap">Charity</span>
were taken off the Canadian service for the conveyance of
troops to the Crimea, and in 1855 the <span class="smcap">Cleopatra</span> was despatched
from London to Melbourne.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Canadian Mail Service proving unprofitable—a
natural result from the way in which it was conducted—it
was transferred to the Messrs. Allan, who undertook to build
a fleet specially for this trade, and to maintain a fortnightly
service to Quebec in summer, and a monthly service to
Portland, Maine, in winter, for the annual subsidy of £24,000.
The Allan mail service to Canada commenced in April, 1856.
A weekly service was instituted in 1859, and has been continued
until the present day. The first four steamers of the line
were built by Messrs. Denny, Dumbarton, and one of them,
the <span class="smcap">Anglo-Saxon</span>, made a passage in nine days five hours—which
was considered a record in those days. The <span class="smcap">Hibernian</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>built in 1861, was the first steamer in the Atlantic trade to
have a spar deck, covering the main deck from stem to stern,
affording shelter for the passengers in heavy weather, and
found to be so advantageous that it has been adopted by all
the other first-class Atlantic companies.</p><br>

<p>The time on passage was further reduced by the <span class="smcap">Polynesian</span>
in 1872. On her first voyage this steamer made the passage
between Quebec and Londonderry in seven days eighteen hours
and fifty-five minutes.</p>

<p>In 1877 the <span class="smcap">Buenos Ayrean</span> made her appearance. This
vessel is remarkable as being the first Atlantic liner constructed
of steel, the material of which all ocean-going steamers
are now built.</p>

<p>In 1881 the <span class="smcap">Parisian</span> was launched, a steamer which has
always been a favourite on the route. She has accommodation
for 200 first, 100 second, and 500 third-class passengers, and is
popularly known as the “ladies’ ship,” a title bestowed upon
her because she is credited with having carried a larger proportion
of lady passengers than any other line. The three
crack boats of the present fleet are the twin-screw steamers
<span class="smcap">Bavarian</span>, <span class="smcap">Tunisian</span>, and <span class="smcap">Ionian</span>. The first of these sailed
on her maiden voyage to Canada in August, 1899, and she was
followed by the <span class="smcap">Tunisian</span> in April, 1900. The <span class="smcap">Ionian</span>, the
latest addition to the passenger fleet, is a twin-screw steamer
of 9,000 tons. So far as outward appearance and internal
arrangements go these are sister ships, though the <span class="smcap">Tunisian</span> is
10,576 tons, against the 9,000 tons of the <span class="smcap">Ionian</span>.</p>

<p>The dimensions of these magnificent steamships are as
follows:—length 520 feet, beam 60 feet, and depth 43 feet.</p>

<p>All the passenger vessels of the Allan fleet are lighted by
electricity, and they are being fitted with the Marconi system
of wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>The new ship (to be named the <span class="smcap">Victorian</span>), now being built
for the line in Belfast is to be supplied with Turbine Engines.
She will be the first transatlantic liner to be fitted with marine
engines of this type.</p>

<p>By its recent purchase (1903) from Messrs. Elder, Dempster
and Co., of fifteen large and full-powered ocean steamships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. has placed itself in the
front rank of steamship owners. Prior to this deal, it owned
the steamers <span class="smcap">Alberta</span>, <span class="smcap">Athabaska</span>, <span class="smcap">Manitoba</span>, <span class="smcap">Michigan</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Ontario</span>, all of which plied on the great inland lakes of Canada
as adjuncts to its train services. These steamers ranged from
498 tons net register to 2,768 tons.</p>

<p>In 1891, the Naval Construction and Armaments Co., at
Barrow, built three magnificent mail and passenger steamers
for the Canadian Pacific Railway. These steamers, the
<span class="smcap">Empress of China</span>, <span class="smcap">Empress of India</span>, and <span class="smcap">Empress of Japan</span>,
are almost identical in measurement, capacity and speed.
They are each 455 feet 6 inches in length; 51 feet 2 inches
beam; and 33 feet 1 inch depth of hold. They are propelled
by twin screws driven by a pair of triple expansion engines of
1,167 horse power. These three steamers have maintained
since 1891, a regular mail service between Vancouver, B.C.,
the Pacific terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and
Japan and China.</p>

<p>The steamers <span class="smcap">Tartar</span> and <span class="smcap">Athenian</span>, two smaller and less
powerful boats are despatched, as intermediate steamers, at
regular intervals.</p>

<p>From Liverpool to Hong Kong—over sea and over land—the
Canadian Pacific Railway Co. stretches a long unbroken line
nearly 12,000 miles in length.</p>

<p>In 1870 Messrs. Flinn, Main &amp; Montgomery despatched the
<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span> from Liverpool to New Orleans. She was the pioneer
steamer of a Company promoted by the firm named for the
purpose of trading between Liverpool and New Orleans, and
called the Liverpool and Mississippi Steamship Co. The views
of the promoters becoming enlarged, they changed the name of
the Company in 1872 to the Mississippi and Dominion Steamship
Co., and entered into the Canadian trade. For many years
the steamers of the Line sailed only between Liverpool and
Quebec and Montreal, but about 1891 a second service was
established, with sailings to and from Bristol and the ports on
the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>In 1894 Messrs. Flinn, Main &amp; Montgomery retired, and the
two sections of the business were taken over—the Liverpool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
service by Messrs. Richards, Mills &amp; Co., and the Bristol service
by Messrs. Elder, Dempster &amp; Co.; the former continued to be
known as the “Dominion Line,” but the latter service was
merged into the Beaver Line, and as such formed part of the
fleet purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., referred to
in a preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>In 1902 the Dominion Line was acquired by the American
Shipping Combine, and in October, 1903, a further change was
made by the transference of the latest and best steamers of the
fleet to the White Star flag.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">There are in Great Britain, as well as in the United States
of America, many steamship lines which are either owned or
controlled by railway corporations. On the south coast of
England, from Harwich to Falmouth inclusive, almost the

the great railway companies, who have made the various ports
along that stretch of coast their termini. In the North
Country, both on the east and west coasts, with a few important
exceptions, the cross-channel and over-sea traffic is operated
by steamship companies, which, while running in connection
with the railway systems of their respective ports, are entirely

<p>The London and South Western Railway Co. has a large
fleet of about twenty powerful steamers, with which it maintains
daily services between Southampton and Havre and
tri-weekly services between Southampton and Cherbourg, and
Southampton and the Channel Islands.</p>

<p>The Great Western Railway Co. from its southern terminus,
Weymouth, runs the Mail Steamers <span class="smcap">Antelope</span>, <span class="smcap">Gazelle</span>, <span class="smcap">Ibex</span>,

<p>From Holyhead the London and North Western Railway
Co. maintain passenger services to Dublin and Greenore. It
is also interested with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
Co. in the Mail Steamers sailing nightly between Fleetwood
and Belfast.</p>

<p>In 1902 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co. purchased
from the Drogheda Steampacket Company, for the sum
of £80,000, the entire fleet of the latter Company, consisting of
five paddle steamers engaged in the Liverpool and Drogheda
Service. The Drogheda Steampacket Company was one of
the oldest Irish steampacket companies, having maintained a
steampacket service between Liverpool and Drogheda for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
upwards of sixty years. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
Co. is also a partner in the Fleetwood and Belfast Mail
Service, and has recently extended the sailings of the Fleetwood
steamers to Londonderry.</p>

<p>A Joint Committee representing several railway companies
operate a Mail Service between Stranraer and Larne. The
paddle steamer <span class="smcap">Princess Victoria</span> or <span class="smcap">Princess May</span> sails twice
daily during the summer months, and once daily during the
winter months to and from Stranraer and Larne, making the
passage each way in about two hours.</p>

<p>The North British Railway Company is the premier Railway
Company of Scotland; its mileage amounts to 1,303 miles. In
conjunction with the Great Northern and North Eastern
Railway Companies it forms the “East Coast Route” from
England to Scotland, and the fastest booked “Railway run”
in the Kingdom is on this route. As an important adjunct
to its railway system, the North British Railway Co. employ on
the Firth of Clyde (making Craigendoran the headquarters),
the well-known paddle passenger steamers <span class="smcap">Lady Clare</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady

<p>No Railway-owned steamers ply on the east coast of Scotland,
but from Grimsby the Great Central Railway Co. have a large
fleet of passenger and cargo steamers sailing regularly to
various continental ports. In July, 1865, this Company (then
known as the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway
Co.) purchased the Anglo-French Steamship Co.’s fleet of
boats, and started running steamers from Grimsby to Hamburg.
The following April the Railway Company commenced a
service of steamers between Grimsby and Rotterdam, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
August, 1867, the service was extended to Antwerp. At the
present time the Great Central Railway Co. possesses a fleet
of fourteen powerful steamers trading regularly between
Grimsby and the continental ports named.</p>

<p>The railway company remaining to be mentioned as a
steamship owning company is the Great Eastern Railway
Company—the Royal British Mail Route to Holland.</p>

<p>The steamers of this Company have been especially built for
the Continental service. The Royal Mail steamers <span class="smcap">Amsterdam</span>,
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <span class="smcap">Chelmsford</span>, <span class="smcap">Dresden</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, run on the
Harwich-Hook of Holland route. They are powerful twin-screw
ocean-going ships of 5,000 indicated horse-power, capable of
steaming 18 knots an hour, each with two distinct sets of
engines, so that in case of accident to one set the vessel can
proceed with the other.</p>

<p>The passenger accommodation is similar to that on the latest
Atlantic Liners, a special feature being the large number of
private cabins for two passengers. The ships are fitted with
electric light, and all latest passenger comforts, including dining,
smoking, and ladies’ saloons, and separate sleeping berths.</p>

<p>The vessels running on the Harwich-Antwerp route are
similar to those on the Hook of Holland service.</p>

<p>In common with all Railway Companies’ steamers, the
Company’s vessels sail under the British flag, and are subject to
the British Board of Trade stringent regulations as to safety and
life-saving appliances.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">The latest development of the marine engine is the Marine
Steam Turbine, the invention of the Hon. C. A. Parsons, F.R.S.,
brother of the present Earl of Rosse, and a son of the builder
of the famous “Birr” telescope, the largest reflecting telescope
ever built.</p>

<p>The first vessel ever fitted with the new type of engine was
appropriately named the <span class="smcap">Turbinia</span>. This vessel is only 100
feet long by 9 feet beam and of a total displacement of 44½
tons, but she is some ten knots faster than any boat afloat of the
same dimensions. Although the weight of her main engines
is only about 4 tons, and the total weight of machinery, screws,
and shafting, tanks, etc., is only 22 tons, she develops the
enormous power of 2,100 I.H.T., being almost 100 H.P. per
ton of machinery.</p>

<p>Prof. Ewing, in April, 1895, made some trials of the <span class="smcap">Turbinia</span>
on the Tyne, the highest speed then recorded being 32·75 knots,
but in June of the same year a speed of 34½ knots was obtained
at Cowes.</p>

<p>Three turbines are used for driving the vessel—high pressure,
intermediate and low pressure. Each turbine driving direct
on to a separate propeller shaft. Reversing is obtained by
means of one or more separate turbines connected to the same
shafts as the propelling turbines and working in a vacuum
when the boat is going ahead.</p>

<p>Several torpedo destroyers and three yachts have been fitted
with Parsons’ turbine engines. The first mercantile vessel to
be so fitted was the <span class="smcap">King Edward</span>, built by Messrs. Denny
Brothers, Dumbarton, in 1901.</p>

<p>On her trial trip she attained a speed of 20½ knots, and
during her first season on the Firth of Clyde (1901) she sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
12,116 knots in 79 days on a coal consumption of 1,429 tons,
at an average speed of 18½ knots per hour. So satisfied were
her owners with her, that they gave an order to the same
builders and engineers for a somewhat larger vessel for the
following season.</p>

<p>The new (1902) turbine steamer is the <span class="smcap">Queen Alexandra</span>,
a three-deck passenger steamer intended also for the Firth of
Clyde passenger service. She is 270 feet long, by 32 feet beam,
and depth 11 feet 6 inches. She has two funnels, but only
one pole mast. Her main deck is completely covered in from
the bow to aft of the engine room, and above the spar deck she
carries a shade deck 100 feet in length, to which passengers
have access, and under which shelter is provided in wet
weather.</p>

<p>Like her sister vessel, the <span class="smcap">King Edward</span>, the main engines
of the <span class="smcap">Queen Alexandra</span> consist of three separate turbines,
each driving its own shaft, the centre turbine being high-pressure,
and the two side turbines low-pressure. The velocity
of the centre shaft is about 700, and of each of the side shafts
1,000 revolutions per minute. On account of the high velocity
at which the shafts revolve it is necessary to increase the
number of propellers driven, and the turbine steamers, therefore,
have five small propellers each, one on the centre shaft,
and two each on the outside shafts. On the builders’ trials
the <span class="smcap">Queen Alexandra</span> exceeded the speed of the <span class="smcap">King
Edward</span> by a knot and a quarter. Her actual speed was 21·63
knots, equal to about 25 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Two Channel steamers designed to carry passengers and
mails, and to be fitted with Parsons’ marine steam turbine
engines, are now (1903) being built on the Clyde by Messrs.
Wm. Denny and Brothers.</p>

<p>Of these, one, the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, is to the order of the South
Eastern and Chatham Railway Co. She will be 310 feet long
and 40 feet broad; and she is to maintain a speed of at least
21 knots. The average time occupied at present on the
passage between Dover and Calais is 65 minutes, but the new
vessel is expected to reduce the time to 50 or even 45 minutes.</p>

<p>The mode of propulsion is practically the same as that on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the <span class="smcap">Queen Alexandra</span>, namely, three shafts carrying five
propellers.</p>

<p>The other Channel steamer referred to as being built is
intended for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway
Co.’s service between Newhaven and Dieppe. Her dimensions
are, length 280 feet, beam 34 feet, draft 22 feet; with a gross
tonnage of 1,100 tons.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Emerald</span>, one of the three yachts referred to at the
beginning of this chapter, is the first vessel fitted with turbine
machinery that ever crossed the Atlantic. She arrived at
New York, after encountering tempestuous weather on the
passage, on the 6th May, 1903. Her qualities as a sea-boat
were severely tested during the voyage, with entirely satisfactory
results. She was built for Sir Christopher Furness,
M.P., by Messrs. Alex. Stephen &amp; Sons, Limited, of Linthouse,
and fitted with machinery by the Parsons Marine Steam
Turbine Co., Limited, of Wallsend-on-Tyne, and it was found
that when the yacht was steaming at the rate of 15 knots per
hour, the machinery ran with an absence of vibration and
noise.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Emerald</span> is a vessel of 756 tons, yacht measurement, and
was chartered by Mr. Geo. Gould, of New York, for six
months from the 15th April, 1903. Mr. Gould sent over to
this country Captain Tod to navigate her across the Atlantic,
with instructions to further experiment on her steaming
capabilities at sea, and to carefully observe her behaviour
compared with the other large steam yachts of which he has had
charge. On the termination of the voyage, Captain Tod
reported that the yacht behaved splendidly; that there was
no racing of propellers, and no vibration; and that the coal
consumption was moderate, considering the weather.</p>

<p>There have been several rumours to the effect that the new
steamers for the Cunard Mail Service are to be fitted with
turbine engines, but these rumours have not been officially
confirmed. In any case these steamers could not be completed
in time to take from the Allan Line the distinction of being
the first Company to own a Transatlantic Mail Turbine
Steamship.</p><br>

<p class="no-indent">The firm of Elder, Dempster &amp; Co. was founded in the year
1868 by Messrs. Alexander Elder and John Dempster, two
gentlemen intimately acquainted with the working of the
African Steamship trade. For 11 years they were the sole
partners, but in 1879 they admitted Mr. (now Sir Alfred)
Jones into the firm, and Mr. W. J. Davey was also taken into
partnership. The original partners, Messrs. Elder and
Dempster, retired from the firm in 1884. Mr. Alexander
Sinclair, who became a partner in 1891, having retired in
1901, the sole partners at the present date are Sir Alfred L.
Jones, K.C.M.G., and Mr. W. J. Davey.</p>

<p>The firm is one of the largest commercial houses in the
world, and in all the various branches of commerce in which
it is interested it takes a foremost position. As steamship
owners it controls the largest fleet of steamers in Great
Britain. The business of the firm extends so rapidly, and new
steamers to meet the necessities of the several trades are so
frequently being added to the fleet, that it is impossible to
give a list of the vessels owned, or under the management of
the firm, which will not in a short time be obsolete, but
according to the official sailing list issued 28th March, 1903,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the following steamers were sailing under the triple flags of
Messrs. Elder, Dempster &amp; Co.:—</p>

<p>As proving the difficulty of stating the number of steamships
under the control of this firm, and at the same time illustrating
the gigantic nature of its commercial operations, it may be
stated that while this volume was in preparation for the Press,
it sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. an entire fleet,
consisting of fifteen large ocean liners. The despatch of the
last Elder-Dempster liner under the Beaver flag, on
Wednesday, March 31st, 1903, was quite an historic event.
She carried with her the first portion of the Rev. J. M. Barr’s
colony, numbering about 2,000 souls. Thousands of spectators
lined the stage, and as the liner sheered away cheer after cheer
rent the air. Sir Alfred Jones, Mr. W. J. Davey, Mr. David
Jones, the Revs. Canon Russell (Manchester), R. O. Greep, Dr.
Lightwood, S. Gasking and H. M. Braithwaite, as well as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
well-known personages in shipping and commerce, were
present. The band of the 1st Liverpool Volunteers played
inspiring music, including tunes reminiscent of home and
friendly associations, first on the stage and afterwards on the
ship.</p>

<p>Sir Alfred Jones expressed his regret, as he witnessed the
multitude on board the Lake Manitoba, that he had consented
to sell his Canadian fleet to the Canadian Pacific Railway.
He said his firm had worked hard to develop Canadian
colonisation, and the full fruit of their efforts was only
becoming visible now when they had left the business. He
commended the object of the expedition, and hoped for its
success. A completely equipped colony of 2,000, with
thousands more to follow in due course, was, he considered, a
novelty.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the three flags borne by the
Elder-Dempster steamers. The Beaver flag no longer exists.
The other two are (1) the white swallow-tail flag with a red
St. George’s cross (gold crown in centre) of the African
Steamship Co.; and the blue swallow-tail flag, with a white St.
George’s cross, of the British and African Steam Navigation
Co. A brief sketch of the history of both of these important
companies, as well as of the Imperial Direct West India Mail
Service Limited, will be found in the succeeding pages of this
volume.</p>

<p>The management of any one of these fleets would be
considered ample employment for most mercantile firms, but
they are only units in the business conducted at that large
hive of commerce, African House, Water Street, Liverpool,
which is, by the way, shortly to be transferred to Colonial
Chambers, now in course of being erected. In addition to the
services mentioned, Messrs. Elder, Dempster &amp; Co. maintain a
service of Mail Steamers between Antwerp and the River
Congo, under the title of the Compagnie Belge Maritime du
Congo, an inter-insular Mail Service at the Canary Islands,
and a Coastal Service at Jamaica. They do also a large Ocean
Tramp business, being prepared to carry cargo, when sufficient
inducement offers, to and from any port in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>It is the existence of such splendidly managed mercantile
fleets, such as the Elder-Dempster Line, that enabled Great
Britain to astonish the world by the rapid and safe transport of
troops and munitions of war during the progress of the late War
in South Africa. Many years of experience in the management
of steamships have enabled the company to design and construct
a magnificent fleet of fast cargo liners, having lofty
’tween decks, and fitted with anti-rolling keels, electric light
and every modern improvement. Several of these were
chartered at an early stage of the war by the British
Admiralty, and retained for voyage after voyage as transports.
Nine steamers, of an aggregate gross tonnage of 52,000 tons,
were requisitioned in this way. In addition to these, the firm’s
steamers carried with remarkable success some 26,000 horses
and 21,000 mules from New Orleans to the Cape, and some
5,000 horses and 3,000 mules from Canada, Hungary, the River
Plate, &amp;c. It may also be mentioned in this connection that
the Elder-Dempster Liner <span class="smcap">Monterey</span> conveyed “Strathcona’s
Horse,” the <span class="smcap">Milwaukee</span> the “Royal Canadians,” and the
<span class="smcap">Montfort</span> the Canadian contingent of Baden-Powell’s Police
from Halifax, N.S., to the Cape. The <span class="smcap">Milwaukee</span> was the
transport selected to convey General Cronje, his family, and
over 500 Boer prisoners to St. Helena. The Elder-Dempster
transports had the good fortune on several occasions to be able
to render material assistance to other transports which had met
with mishaps. Thus they came to the assistance of the
<span class="smcap">Carinthia</span> a few days after she stranded at Aux Cayes, and,
taking off her cargo of mules, carried them on to their
destination. The <span class="smcap">Montrose</span> turned up just in the nick of
time to save the crew when the ill-fated <span class="smcap">Mexican</span> foundered
off the Cape, and when the <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span> stranded it was again
an Elder-Dempster liner, the <span class="smcap">Lake Erie</span>, that came to her
assistance, and did all that was possible to rescue the crew.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1902 Messrs. Elder, Dempster &amp; Co.
commenced running the luxuriously appointed ocean liner
<span class="smcap">Lake Simcoe</span> on pleasure cruises to the Norwegian Fjords.
Those persons who have had the pleasure of travelling by this
vessel are most enthusiastic in their praise of the ship, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
officers and her equipment, and of all who are responsible for
the comfort and enjoyment of the passengers. The <span class="smcap">Lake
Simcoe</span> is probably one of the largest pleasure steamers trading
to the Norwegian Coast, but her rates of passage money are by
no means commensurate with her size. It is an opportunity
of visiting the Land of the Midnight Sun in comfort and even
luxury which ought not to be missed. The fact that a large
proportion of the commanders, officers, engineers, seamen and
firemen serving under the firm are Royal Naval Reservists
renders the Elder-Dempster fleet additionally valuable to the
nation.</p><br>

THE AFRICAN STEAMSHIP COMPANY.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Two years (1852) prior to the outbreak of the Crimean War,
the African Steamship Company was incorporated by Royal
Charter with limited liability. The initial capital was
£250,000 in 12,500 shares of £20 each. The first directors of
the Company were—Sir John Campbell, K.C.H. (Chairman),
James Hartley, Esq. (Director of the P. and O. Co.), John
Black, Esq., Henry William Schneider, Esq., Macgregor
Laird, Esq., Henry William Currie, Esq., William Law
Ogilby, Esq., and Charles William Gregory, Esq. Bankers,
Messrs. Currie &amp; Co., Cornhill.</p>

<p>The prospectus of the company, as published in the “Times,”
13th July, 1852, was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This Company is formed to carry out a contract with H.M.
Government for the monthly conveyance of the mails to
Madeira, Teneriffe, and the principal ports and places on the
West Coast of Africa, viz., Goree, Bathurst, Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Cape Coast Castle, Accra, Whydah, Badagny, Lagos,
Bonny, Old Calabar, Cameroons and Fernando Po; and to
establish a line of steam communication between Sierra
Leone and the British West Indies as soon as satisfactory
arrangements are made with the Government.</p>

<p>“The contract for the mails was taken by Mr. Macgregor
Laird in December last, and is for a term of ten years from
the 1st September next. The annual payment by the
Government commences at £23,250, and diminishes at the
rate of £500 yearly during the continuance of the contract,
making an average payment of £21,500 per annum.</p>

<p>“Five iron screw steamships for this service are in the
course of construction by Mr. John Laird, of Birkenhead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
with engines by Messrs. George Forrester &amp; Co., and
Fawcett, Preston &amp; Co., of Liverpool.</p>

<p>“The first of these vessels is to be launched on the 3rd July,
and will be ready to commence the mail service in accordance
with the terms of the contract on the 1st September. Two
of them have capacity for 700, two of them for 1,000, and
one for 250 tons cargo, with excellent accommodation for
first-class passengers. The company are also to have Mr.
Laird’s services as Managing Director. A negotiation is
going on with the Portuguese Government for an extension
of the line from Fernando, the valuable African possession.</p>

<p>“Plymouth will be the first port of arrival, and the last
port of departure for the company’s vessels, but the voyage
will terminate at and commence from London.”</p>
</div>

<p>The steamers referred to were the <span class="smcap">Forerunner</span>, <span class="smcap">Faith</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hope</span>, <span class="smcap">Charity</span>, and <span class="smcap">Northern Lights</span>.</p>

<p>The trading operations between London and Africa not
being profitable, the Board of Directors (about 1860) proposed
to wind up the company.</p>

<p>On the solicitations of Messrs. Fletcher &amp; Parr, of Liverpool,
they were induced to try the trade from Liverpool to the West
Coast of Africa. The result of the trial was extremely satisfactory,
and Liverpool became the home-port of the fleet.
The business of the company increased rapidly, and the
shareholders received their dividends for some time with
gratifying regularity, but unfortunately about ten years after
the change from London to Liverpool, the relations between
the Board of Directors at the former port and the managing
agents at Liverpool became somewhat strained.</p>

<p>In spite of a great financial loss, caused by the defalcations
of the Secretary; of a small and inefficient fleet; and a policy
on the part of the Directors which was decidedly peculiar, the
company maintained a struggling existence until 1891, when
it passed into the management of the firm of “Elder, Dempster
and Co.” Under the vigorous and successful management of
this firm, the African Steamship Company started on a new
and prosperous career. Instead of, as in 1875, possessing a
fleet of seven ocean steamers and two coast vessels, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
company now owns thirty-three modern, large and powerful
ocean steamers, ranging from 1,000 to 5,200 tons each, and
six branch steamers, four of which are 1,000 tons each.</p>

<p>An Express Service to the Coast has been established by
means of a fleet of fast steamers of the <span class="smcap">Jebba</span> type, which reach
Sekondi, the centre of the new gold mining industry, in 15 days.
They have been specially constructed for the trade in which they
are engaged, and no skill has been wanting nor expense spared
to make them the most perfect of their kind. The passenger
accommodation has received special attention. The saloons
are spacious, the staterooms lofty and well ventilated, while
extensive promenade and bridge decks enable passengers to
enjoy the invigorating sea breezes secure alike from sun and
rain.</p>

<p>The company grants special facilities for visiting the
beautiful islands of Madeira, Teneriffe and Grand Canary,
issuing special holiday tickets, which include first-class passage
out and home, and a fortnight’s board and accommodation at
the Hotel Metropole, Las Palmas, for £15. Passengers have
also the option of returning <em>via</em> Barcelona or Genoa, by the
steamers of “La Veloce Navigazione Italiana a Vapore” (The
Italian Express Steam Navigation Co.).</p>

<p>The Royal Mail Steamers of the African Steamship Co.,
conjointly with the steamers of the British and African Steam
Navigation Co., sail from Liverpool thrice a week for the
Canary Islands and the West Coast, from Hamburg and
Amsterdam weekly, and from Antwerp (Cie Belge Maritime
du Congo) for Teneriffe, Sierra Leone and Congo Ports every
third week.</p><br>

THE BRITISH &amp; AFRICAN STEAM NAVIGATION<br>
COMPANY, LIMITED (1900).</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This Company was projected in 1868 by a number of gentlemen
practically acquainted with the trade of the West Coast
of Africa. Amongst these were Mr. Alexander Elder and Mr.
John Dempster who in that year founded the firm of Elder,
Dempster &amp; Co., a firm whose ramifications during these later
years, under the guidance of Sir Alfred L. Jones, K.C.M.G.,
and Mr. Davey, may be said to extend throughout the
civilized world.</p>

<p>Three steamers of about 1,300 tons gross each, were specially
built to the order of the new company, by Messrs. Randolph
Elder &amp; Co., of Glasgow, for the West African trade, and were
named the <span class="smcap">Bonny</span>, <span class="smcap">Roquelle</span>, and <span class="smcap">Congo</span>.</p>

<p>The Pioneer steamer, the <span class="smcap">Bonny</span>, sailed from Liverpool in
January, 1869, and thereafter a monthly service was maintained
between Glasgow, Liverpool and the West Coast of
Africa. After several years’ employment in this trade, the
<span class="smcap">Roquelle</span> was sold to Messrs. P. M. Tintore &amp; Co., Barcelona,
and is still sailing from the Mersey under the Spanish flag.</p>

<p>So successful were these steamers that in 1869 it was decided
to add three more to the fleet.</p>

<p>The new steamers were the <span class="smcap">Liberia</span>, <span class="smcap">Loanda</span> and <span class="smcap">Volta</span>,
also specially built for the trade by the late Mr. John Elder,
the distinguished brother of Mr. Alexander Elder, whose early
death towards the end of 1869 was so much deplored by the
ship-building and engineering world. The gross tonnage of
these three vessels was increased to about 1,500 tons each.</p>

<p>It was considered desirable during the same year to register<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the Company as an Incorporated Company. The Registered
Office of the Company was in Glasgow, but Mr. Alexander
Elder and Mr. John Dempster conducted its operations in
Liverpool.</p>

<p>With the six steamers the Company now possessed the
sailings were increased to fortnightly.</p>

<p>In 1874 the sailings from Glasgow were abandoned, cargo to
and from that port being transhipped at Liverpool.</p>

<p>As the trade expanded, additions were regularly made to the
fleet, and in 1879 sailings between Hamburg and the West
Coast of Africa were commenced. In 1883 the Company was
registered as a limited company, at which time its fleet had
increased to 20 steamers and 2 hulks with a gross registered
tonnage of 30,753 tons.</p>

<p>The following year (1884) Mr. Elder and Mr. Dempster
retired from the firm of Elder, Dempster &amp; Co., which since
1879 had consisted of these gentlemen and Mr. (now Sir A. L.)
Jones, and Mr. W. J. Davey. Messrs. Elder and Dempster,
however, remained Managing Directors of the Company until
1900, Mr. Elder having for some years previous to this date
occupied the position of Chairman.</p>

<p>In 1900 Messrs. Elder, Dempster &amp; Co., purchased the entire
business and assets of the British and African Steam Navigation
Co., Limited, and with the addition of 9 large steamers,
suitable for outside trades, formed a new company with a
share capital of £1,000,000, and Debenture Stock of £800,000.
The new company has a fleet of 35 steamers with a total gross
registered tonnage of 107,000 tons.</p>

<p>While the bulk of its operations continue to be in connection
with the West Coast of Africa, several of its steamers are
employed in the North Atlantic and other trades.</p>

<p>The contrast between the first steamer, the <span class="smcap">Bonny</span>, and the
latest, the <span class="smcap">Burutu</span>, built in 1902, will be seen by the following
comparison of their respective dimensions:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonny</span>, length 261·0 feet, beam 30·2 feet, depth 23 feet.
Gross 1,326 tons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burutu</span>, length 360·0 feet, beam 44·2 feet, depth 26 feet.
Gross 5,200 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>In the later steamers of the fleet, the vessels of the <span class="smcap">Burutu</span>
type, traders and other travellers reach Sekondi, the centre of
the new gold mining industry, in about 13 days from Liverpool.
No skill has been wanting nor expense spared to make these
vessels the most perfect of their kind, and exactly suitable for
tropical trade.</p>

<p>A special feature of the steamers is the system of overhead
trunk ventilation, by which an imperceptible current of fresh
air is kept continually circulating through the lofty and well
lighted state rooms, making them cool and agreeable in the
hottest weather.</p>

<p>Passengers by the Royal Mail Steamers belonging to the
British and African Company, are granted special facilities for
visiting the beautiful islands of Madeira, Teneriffe and Grand
Canary. The Company issues a special holiday ticket for £15,
which includes Saloon passage out and home, and a fortnight’s
board and accommodation at the Hotel Metropole, Las Palmas.
Passengers by these steamers who may wish to visit the Mediterranean,
have also the option of returning from the islands via
Barcelona or Genoa, by the steamers of the Italian Express
Steam Navigation Co.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail Steamers of the British and African Steam
Navigation Co., conjointly with the steamers of the African
Steam Ship Co., sail from Liverpool three times a week for the
Canary Islands and the West Coast of Africa, and from
Hamburg and Rotterdam weekly.</p><br>

IMPERIAL DIRECT WEST INDIA MAIL<br>
SERVICE, LIMITED.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">For years the Island of Jamaica, the Pearl of the Antilles, had
been decadent, its planters cast down and despairing because
it was impossible, owing to the heavily subsidized continental
beet sugar, to grow cane sugar at a profit. And, although
physicians in the United States were sending their patients to
seek renewed health and energy “from the balmy breezes
laden with health giving ozone which blow over the island,”
British Life Insurance offices placed a black mark against
Jamaica, and demanded an additional premium from their
policy holders for permission to visit its shores. But the dark
commercial cloud is passing, and the island has entered upon
an era of prosperity which bids fair to be greater and more
permanent than even the golden days of the sugar planter.
It is an open secret that for this the Jamaicans are indebted in
great measure to the enterprise of Messrs. Elder, Dempster
and Co., who have practically created the demand in Great
Britain for Jamaica grown fruits, and who have established
a service of swift steamers, specially built for the trade. This
Line of steamers, which is known as the Imperial Direct West
India Mail Service although only established in the first year
of the present century, has already achieved a remarkable
success. In addition to bringing to England over 50,000
bunches of bananas per month, as well as other West Indian
fruits, tobacco, coffee, sugar, rum, and other varieties of
tropical produce, the steamers carry a large and increasing
number of passengers each voyage between Great Britain and
the colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>The home port of the steamers is Avonmouth, near Bristol,
from which a fortnightly sailing is maintained throughout the
year to Kingston (Jamaica), but it is probable that the service
will soon be increased to a weekly one. In recognition of the
invaluable services rendered by these steamers both to the
Empire and to the colony, their Royal Highnesses the Prince
and Princess of Wales paid a visit of inspection to the R.M.S.
<span class="smcap">Port Royal</span>, at Avonmouth, on the 5th March, 1902.</p>

<p>The vessels at present engaged in the direct Mail Service
were all built in 1901, and are named, the <span class="smcap">Port Royal</span>, <span class="smcap">Port
Antonio</span>, <span class="smcap">Port Morant</span>, and <span class="smcap">Port Maria</span>. The first two
steamers named are sister ships and are identical in measurement,
viz., length 382 feet, beam 46 feet 6 inches, and depth
32 feet. Each is propelled by twin screws, and fitted with
triple expansion engines capable of maintaining a speed of 14
knots per hour, and carries about 5,000 tons cargo. They can
each accommodate 100 first-class passengers and 50 second-class
passengers. The saloons and staterooms are handsomely
decorated, and are fitted so as to secure a maximum of comfort
for the passengers. The cuisine and the appointments generally
being those appertaining to a first-class mail and
passenger steamer.</p>

<p>A new mail steamer of considerably larger dimensions than
any of the preceding steamers of the fleet, is now in course of
construction and is expected to make her first voyage early in
1904. It is proposed to call her the <span class="smcap">Port Kingston</span>.</p>

<p>These steamers sail from Avonmouth Dock, Bristol, every
alternate Saturday, and make the voyage as a rule in from 12
to 14 days. The rates for passengers are:—Saloon (single)
£18 to £25 pounds; (return) £32 to £40, according to the
position of the stateroom, and number of persons occupying
same. In the second saloon the charge is £14 for the single
passage, and £25 for the return.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Delta</span>, belonging to the same Company, makes a trip
round Jamaica every week; she has first-class accommodation
for passengers, and affords a splendid opportunity of seeing
the coast and towns around the Island. The charge for first-class
passengers is £3 for the round trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Arrangements have been made with the Hamburg-American
Line, running between Kingston (Jamaica) and Central American
Ports, to carry passengers booked by Imperial Direct West
India Line of Steamers to the following Central American Ports,
viz., Savanilla, Cartagena, Port Limon, and Greytown, at an
inclusive first-class fare between Kingston and any of the
above Ports of £6 3s. per adult. Passengers travelling on
these tickets will be accommodated on special terms at the
Myrtle Bank Hotel (Kingston), during the time between the
arrival of the Mail Steamers and the departure of the Steamer
of the Hamburg-American Line. There is also a good service
from Kingston to Cuba. The Cuba steamer leaves Kingston
the day after the arrival of the mail steamer from England.</p>

<p>Passengers can also be booked through, via the Colon and
Panama Railway, to the principal ports on the Chilian Coast.
The steamers of the Pacific Mail Co. and Campania Sud-Americana
Co. leave Panama weekly for the South, reaching
Callao in about nine days and arriving at Valparaiso in about
21 days. Seeing that for years past the climate of Jamaica
has been libelled as unhealthy, it cannot be too strongly
affirmed, that from a medical point of view, the wonderful air
of the hilly districts is unrivalled; it being in every way equal
to that of the better known European winter resorts, to which it
bids fair to become a serious rival.</p>

THE CITY OF DUBLIN STEAMPACKET<br>
COMPANY.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the summer of the year 1822 Mr. C. W. Williams, of
Dublin, crossed over to Liverpool with the object of inducing
the merchants to take shares in a line of steampackets he
proposed building for the Liverpool and Dublin trade. Except
to the most sanguine, the time did not appear to be favourable
for such a scheme. A large fleet of sailing smacks maintained
daily communication (subject to the weather) between the
two ports, carrying all kinds of goods, and even cattle. The
steampackets <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span> and <span class="smcap">Belfast</span> sailed with passengers
only every alternate day from each side. Both these vessels
had already won for themselves a reputation, the former being
the first steampacket to ply regularly between England and
Ireland, and the latter having made a passage in the then
remarkably short time of 12½ hours. Besides this, “The
Original Steampacket Company,” a new company (with
powerful Government influence), including amongst its shareholders
Lord Blaney, Major-General Preeth, Sir John Tobin,
&amp;c., and trading under the title of the St. George Steampacket
Company, had in April preceding launched two of the largest
and most powerful steampackets that had yet been built, viz.,
the <span class="smcap">St. Patrick</span> and the <span class="smcap">St. George</span>. This latter vessel on
the 13th September made a passage from Dublin in 11½ hours,
thus making a record which she herself broke on the 23rd
April, 1824, by making a passage from Liverpool to Dublin
in 10 hours 40 minutes. In addition to the already established
steam and sailing lines, a third local steampacket company,
supported by the traders, the “Dublin and Liverpool Steam
Navigation Company,” was in course of formation. It is not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
therefore, surprising under these circumstances that Mr.
Williams, a stranger in Liverpool, failed to obtain the
financial support to his scheme which he desired. It is the
more to his credit that, though disappointed in Liverpool, he
persevered with his project in Dublin with so much success
that he was enabled to return to Liverpool in February of the
following year (1823) and place an order with “Frigate”
Wilson for the pioneer steamer of the future famous City of
Dublin Steampacket Company, the <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span>, a vessel
of 130 h.p. It was an express stipulation with the builder
that this steamer should be constructed of such materials and
in such a manner as to withstand the severity of the winter
navigation. The <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span> differed from her competitors
in two respects—(1) in carrying general cargo in
addition to live stock and passengers, and (2) in maintaining
the service uninterruptedly throughout the twelve months.</p>

<p>A month later Mr. Wilson was again applied to to build a
second vessel for the company, but in consequence of his
having that very morning (5th March) contracted to build the
<span class="smcap">Hy. Bell</span> for the Glasgow trade, it was not till some days
later the contract was made for the building of the <span class="smcap">Town of
Liverpool</span>, to be commenced as soon as the <span class="smcap">Hy. Bell</span> was
launched.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span> made her maiden voyage on Saturday,
the 20th March, 1824, and Mr. Samuel Perry, of 16, Water
Street, was appointed agent to the company. She anticipated
by about six months the operations of the traders’ company
(the Dublin and Liverpool Steam Navigation), whose first
steamer, the <span class="smcap">Liffey</span>, 305 tons burden, and 110 h.p., did not
sail until the 13th September following. From the outset the
managers of the City of Dublin Company seemingly did not
regard the Original Steampacket Company as formidable
opponents, but they determined either to vanquish or acquire
the other two companies, the greater of which was the St.
George Steampacket Company. The second company was well
supported by the Liverpool merchants, and kept its sailings
(with goods and passengers) throughout the year. In December
of the same year (1824) the <span class="smcap">Mersey</span> joined the <span class="smcap">Liffey</span>, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the July following the <span class="smcap">Commerce</span>, one of the largest steampackets
(up to that date) built in this port, was added to the
fleet. This company’s packets proceeded direct to Dublin, and
discharged at Custom House Quay. On Saturday, 5th
February, 1825, the third vessel belonging to the City of
Dublin Steampacket Company was launched from the yard of
Dawson and Pearson, South Shore, and on the 22nd April
succeeding the managers issued the following public notice:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The City of Dublin Steampacket Company announce to the
public that in consequence of the many complaints hitherto
made of want of storage room in Dublin for
goods going and coming by their steam vessels, they
have taken the lot of ground immediately opposite the
Packet Station on the North Wall, and are about to erect a
convenient and commodious store on the same for the accommodation
of the merchants and traders of Dublin. The
Company have increased their capital to £100,000, and are
proceeding with every possible expedition in completing
their number of vessels, by which means they will shortly be
able to despatch one daily from Dublin and another from
Liverpool. The trustees have reserved the remainder of the
shares now unappropriated exclusively for the accommodation
of shippers and importers. Their vessels, the <span class="smcap">City of
Dublin</span> and <span class="smcap">Town of Liverpool</span>, continue to ply as usual.
Their third and fourth vessels, the <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span> and <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>,
are nearly complete, and the fifth and sixth will be ready by
the end of the year.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the summer of 1825 the City of Dublin Company
despatched their new steamer <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span> on the same day and
at the same hour as the <span class="smcap">St. George</span>. They were careful to
inform those interested that this was done “not with a view
of opposition, but for the purpose of establishing her (the
<span class="smcap">Hibernia</span>’s) character for speed and seaworthiness.” They
were equally careful to point out that “the <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span> has
already made six voyages in company with the <span class="smcap">St. George</span>,
and has on all occasions proved herself an extremely safe
and fleet vessel, and not inferior to that well-known
steampacket.” They also mentioned the inconvenience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
delay and expense of landing by boats at Kingstown, all of
which might be avoided by taking their magnificent steampackets
direct to North Wall.</p>

<p>The St. George Company replied to this courteous announcement
by also informing the public that the companionship of
the <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span> was unsought for and undesired by them. It
was not to be expected that the Liverpool companies would
permit a strange company to take a lion’s share of the trade,
and not make a practical protest. Consequently, in the
autumn of 1825, the fares from Liverpool to Dublin were
reduced to 5s. cabin and 6d. steerage, and on Monday,
September 5th, one of the steamers sailed with upwards of 700
passengers at 6d. each. Early the following year (1st
February, 1826) the managers of the City of Dublin Steampacket
Company purchased the Dublin and Liverpool Steam
Navigation Company, and increased the capital of the company
to £250,000, in shares of £100 each. Shareholders, in addition
to their share of the profits of the undertaking, were offered
the following advantages:—</p>

<p>(1) Free passage by all the company’s vessels.</p>

<p>(2) Free storage for a limited time in the company’s stores.</p>

<p>(3) Special accommodation in the payment of freights and
charges.</p>

<p>The company having grown with a rapidity probably
without a parallel, decided to extend its sailings to Belfast and
Waterford, and, if desirable, to other ports. It had now a
fleet (afloat or building) of fourteen new and powerful
steamers, viz., <span class="smcap">City of Dublin</span>, <span class="smcap">Town of Liverpool</span>, <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span>,
<span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, <span class="smcap">Liffey</span>, <span class="smcap">Mersey</span>, <span class="smcap">Commerce</span>, <span class="smcap">Mona</span>, <span class="smcap">Leeds</span>, <span class="smcap">Gipsey</span>,
<span class="smcap">Manchester</span>, <span class="smcap">Birmingham</span>, <span class="smcap">Sheffield</span> and <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>. On
the 29th August, 1826, the Government established a mail
service between Liverpool and Kingstown, with most injurious
results to the existing steampacket companies. The managers
of the City of Dublin Company interviewed the Secretary to
the General Post Office in order to obtain some modification
of the opposition, but without being able to do so. They
thereupon published the result of their negotiations, and
appealed to the public for support against the unjustifiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
action shown by the Government. “The Post Office having
now established packets on the station, have, with a view of
covering the heavy expenses incident to the same,
endeavoured to engross the trade in passengers, carriages,
horses, &amp;c., to the great injury of this and other companies;
while at the same time they are exempt from the payment
of port dues and other charges ... which are already a
tax on this company to the amount of £10,000 per annum.
Under terms so unequal and disadvantageous, it is evident
this opposition has none of the ingredients of fair opposition,
were such even justifiable, where Government on the one
hand, and private shipowners on the other, are the
competitors.”</p>

<p>At this period (1827) there was considerable friction between
the Mersey Dock Board and the company, the managers of the
latter considering greater facilities ought to be given for the
working of their traffic in view of the fact that they annually
spent in Liverpool £100,000 in outfits and repairs. To meet
the Government opposition the company purchased the sailing
brig <span class="smcap">Tyne</span>, which they loaded fortnightly with rough goods,
and towed to sea by their own tug <span class="smcap">Mars</span>. In 1828, in addition
to their daily service to Dublin, the company had a twice-weekly
service to Belfast, and once a week to Drogheda. A
fortnightly service between Dublin and Bordeaux was commenced
on the 20th June, 1827. The <span class="smcap">Ballinasloe</span>, built in
1829, was furnished with a powerful blast cylinder to ventilate
the holds, being the first steamer to be so fitted. The same
year the <span class="smcap">Manchester</span> and the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> were both wrecked,
but fortunately without loss of life.</p>

<p>The steampacket <span class="smcap">City of Londonderry</span>, built in 1827 for a
local company, was sold by auction on the 8th October, 1829,
and purchased by the City of Dublin Company. Her new
owners took up the station vacated by the Derry Company, and
maintained a weekly service between Liverpool and Londonderry
for a number of years. The Clarence Dock having been
opened in September, 1830, the City of Dublin Company were
allotted loading and discharging berths in it on the 25th
March, 1831, which berths they have used continuously to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
present date (1903), a period of over seventy years, when they
were transferred to the Nelson Dock.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the early history of the
company their most powerful trade competitors were the
St. George Steampacket Company. One of the steamers of
the latter company (the <span class="smcap">Lord Blaney</span>), while on a voyage
from Liverpool to Newry, was lost with all hands. With a
chivalry unusual in commerce (ignoring the fact that the
vessel belonged to a rival company) the City of Dublin
Company headed a list for the benefit of the relatives of the
drowned seamen and others with a subscription of one hundred
pounds. Civil war had been raging in Portugal for a number
of years, the leaders being Don Miguel (the usurper) and Dom
Pedro, on behalf of his daughter, Donna Maria (Legitimist).
Two at least of the company’s steamers, the <span class="smcap">Leeds</span> and
<span class="smcap">Birmingham</span>, were chartered as transports to Dom Pedro; and
it was the latter vessel, under the command of Captain
Beazley, which, on the 16th July, 1833, brought to England
the news of the complete defeat and capture of the fleet of
Don Miguel. On the 6th November, 1834, the <span class="smcap">Leeds</span> struck
on Furlong Rock. No lives were lost, the crew and passengers
being taken off by the company’s steamer <span class="smcap">Commerce</span>. The
<span class="smcap">Leeds</span> having got off the rock, sank inside the jetty at
Holyhead, but was subsequently raised.</p>

<p>In 1836 the company built four steamers to compete against
the Government mail steamers. They were the <span class="smcap">Queen
Victoria</span>, <span class="smcap">Duchess of Kent</span>, <span class="smcap">Royal Adelaide</span>, and the famous
<span class="smcap">Royal William</span>. In June of this year (1836) a bill in Parliament
for increasing the capital of the company was read three
times and passed.</p>

<p>About this time the directors of the company had under
consideration the establishing of steam communication between
Liverpool and New York. A meeting was held in the
company’s office in Water Street, there being present, amongst
others, Sir John Tobin. Sir John had on the stocks a large
steamer, and it was decided that the Transatlantic service
should be established, the pioneer vessel to be the <span class="smcap">Royal
William</span>, to be followed by the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span> (Sir John Tobin’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>new steamer) as soon as she was ready for the service. In
accordance with these arrangements, the <span class="smcap">Royal William</span>
sailed from the George’s Pierhead on July 5th, 1838, for New
York, and the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span> followed her on September 20th.
These steamers have the honour of being the first passenger
liners between Liverpool and New York. The <span class="smcap">Royal William</span>
proved to be too small for the Transatlantic trade, and in 1839
she resumed her sailings on the Liverpool and Kingstown
station.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>On and from the 20th June, 1839, the Government determined
that a mail steamer should be despatched every morning
and evening from Liverpool to Dublin, <em>via</em> Kingstown, on the
arrival of the respective mail trains from London. The
Government steam packets were appointed to sail with the
morning mails, and the City of Dublin steam packets with the
evening mails. The directors of the City of Dublin Company
were determined that their steamers should surpass the
Government boats, and in December, 1840, they contracted for
two new steamers for the mail service to be superior to any
seagoing steamers afloat, and to do the passage from Liverpool
to Kingstown in nine hours. Three years later (15th April,
1843) the company commenced their Liverpool and North
Wales service with the new iron steamer <span class="smcap">Erin-go-Bragh</span>.
The steamer <span class="smcap">Ayrshire Lassie</span> was placed on the station the
next season (May, 1844), followed in 1845 by the <span class="smcap">Prince of
Wales</span>, and later by the <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>, which two
steamers maintained a daily service throughout the summer
season for many years, and until the station was transferred
to the present North Wales Steampacket Company.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the North Lancashire Railways, the City
of Dublin Company instituted, in 1844, a steamship service
between Dublin and Fleetwood, the first steamer employed
being the <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span>. The Company’s trade between England
and Ireland had increased so rapidly that in 1845 the directors
placed orders to build eight vessels, viz., five paddle steamers
and three auxiliary screw schooners.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>The long contest between the Admiralty and the company
for the carriage of the English and Irish mails came to an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>end in 1850, when the Lords of the Admiralty determined to
withdraw their steamers from the Irish mail service. The
City of Dublin Co. had now a new competitor in the Chester
and Holyhead Railway Company, who had steamers in connection
with their railway service. The former company, who
recognised the great importance of placing vessels on the Holyhead
station, put in a tender in response to the Admiralty’s
invitation, which tender was actually accepted. No tender
was put in by the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company,
who, it was believed, did not suppose anyone would compete
with them and that they could obtain their own terms. Before
the Admiralty’s acceptance of the City of Dublin Company’s
tender was confirmed by the Government the railway company
got notice of what was being arranged, and pressure was
brought to bear upon the Government to prevent the City of
Dublin Company’s contract from being ratified. The move
was successful, with the result that tenders were again asked
for. The City of Dublin Company were most unfairly treated,
for the figure at which they had tendered was made public,
and consequently the railway company were able to under-cut
it. In anticipation of this course being adopted the managing
director of the City of Dublin Company recommended a tender
to be put in at a very diminished figure, the great importance
of securing a footing on the Holyhead station being fully
perceived by him. The City of Dublin tendered at £25,000
per annum, which was £5,000 a year less than the Chester and
Holyhead Railway Company’s offer, and the result was that
the City of Dublin Company obtained the contract. They
purchased from the Admiralty two of the mail boats, the <span class="smcap">St.
Columba</span> and the <span class="smcap">Llewellyn</span>, and in May, 1850, took over the
mail service, running the steamers at the same hours as they
were run by the Admiralty. A strong effort was made by the
opponents of the company to deprive them of their contract, and
a select Parliamentary Committee was appointed, which
reported in favour of what had been arranged. This report
made it clear that the company’s first offer was a reasonable
one, and subsequent events proved the wisdom of the company’s
directors determining to hold the contract at all hazards. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
contest, it will be seen, was between the City of Dublin Company
and the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company rather
than with the Lords of the Admiralty—indeed, so strong was
the feeling some time afterwards that the railway company
refused to book passengers by the mail steamers, or advertise
their sailings in the railway time tables, which only showed
the sailings of the railway company’s steamers.</p>

<p>But if the City of Dublin Company was thus happily relieved
from rivalry on the Holyhead mail station, it speedily found
itself involved in the most serious struggle which probably ever
occurred in the steamship coasting trade. Yielding to the
solicitations of the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway Company,
the directors of the City of Dublin Company agreed to place a
steamer on the Liverpool and Waterford station. The Waterford
Company and the Cork Company immediately began a
daily service to and from Liverpool and Dublin, and despatched
a steamer twice a week to Belfast. Entering into an alliance
with the British and Irish Steampacket Co., the City of Dublin
Company and its ally responded by opposing the Cork Company
on the Liverpool and Cork station, sailing the <span class="smcap">Duchess Of
Kent</span>, <span class="smcap">Emerald</span>, <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, &amp;c., every Tuesday and Friday from
Liverpool and from Cork. After a keen contest, lasting over
twelve months, a conference took place between Mr. Malcomson,
representing the Waterford and Cork Steamship Companies,
and one of the directors of the City of Dublin Company.
No reference was made at this conference as to the cause of the
contest, nor to the conduct of any of the parties during its
continuance, the sole object being to suggest the most speedy
mode of restoring peace, and the following arrangement was
finally decided upon:—The City of Dublin Steampacket Company
agreed to sell their claims on the London line to the
British and Irish Steampacket Company, this line to be worked
by the vessels of the latter company and of Messrs. Malcomson;
the City of Dublin to transfer their Liverpool and Belfast
service to the Cork Steamship Company; the entire sea traffic
between Holyhead and Dublin to be assigned to the City of
Dublin Company. This agreement has been honourably
adhered to by all the companies concerned, amongst whom a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
most friendly feeling exists, but time has wrought its changes
on the various lines. Malcomson’s steamers have long since
ceased to run between Dublin and London, the Cork Company’s
steamers were withdrawn in 1854 from the Liverpool and
Belfast service, and the London and North Western Railway
Company have a large fleet of passenger and cargo steamers
plying daily between Dublin and Holyhead.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1854 a better feeling prevailed, and
the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company, together with the
London and North Western Railway Company, entered into
negotiations with the City of Dublin Company, and, with the
approval of the Government, an Act of Parliament was
obtained in order to bring about an improved passenger and
mail service between London and Dublin, via Holyhead and
Kingstown. Considerable delay took place in the subsequent
negotiations. However, at the end of 1858 matters were
settled, and in January of the following year the Postmaster-General
entered into a contract with the two railway companies
and the City of Dublin Steampacket Company, who jointly
undertook the sea service, and with the two railway companies,
who undertook the land transit. By private agreement,
however, with the railway companies, the City of Dublin
Company became solely responsible for the sea service, and
provided the four steamers. This service gave the greatest
satisfaction to the travelling public; the contract was for
fourteen years certain, and then from year to year, terminable
by twelve months’ notice, the subsidy being £85,900 per annum
for the sea service, and £50,000 per annum for the land.</p>

<p>Twelve years after this service had been commenced, the
London and North Western Railway Company, who had by
that time absorbed the Chester and Holyhead Railway, commenced
a rail connection between the harbour of Dublin and
three of the principal Irish railway companies, which connection
was completed in 1876, and the London and North
Western Company began to run a service of steamers in direct
opposition to the mail route. Under the terms of their agreement
with the City of Dublin Company, the railway company
had the power of fixing the fares by the mail route, which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
exercised by maintaining the high fares by the mail and
charging low fares by the railway steamers. The competition
increased in intensity every year, with the result of largely
diverting the passenger traffic from the mail route, the ultimate
object of the railway being to bring about the abandonment of
the Kingstown service, and to secure all the traffic for the
railway boats to Dublin. In 1881 the City of Dublin Company
brought the London and North Western Railway Company
before the Railway Commissioners, who ordered a reduction of
the mail fares. Immediately after this order was made, the
Post Office authorities intimated their intention of terminating
the existing mail contract, and of asking for fresh tenders for
the service between Holyhead and Kingstown. In 1882 the
City of Dublin Company put in a tender. Months were
allowed to pass, and in January, 1883, it was announced that
the Government had accepted a tender of the London and
North Western Railway Company. It then transpired that
the railway company, as well as the City of Dublin Company,
had tendered for the Holyhead and Kingstown service, and
that the latter company’s tender was the lower of the two, but
the Government, instead of accepting it, had negotiated a
contract for the throughout service with the railway company,
which would have enabled them to convey the mails and passengers
in the railway steamers to Dublin instead of to
Kingstown.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">William Watson</span>, Esq. (late Chairman City of Dublin Steampacket Co.).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It can well be understood that the public, who were well
pleased to have the two lines of steamers, had no intention of
being deprived of the Kingstown route, and a storm of indignation
arose over the country. The Government professed
that in making the new arrangement they were acting with
economy, but this was shown to be a mere subterfuge, for they
had agreed to pay the railway company £106,000 a year—only
a trifling amount less than they would have paid if the steampacket
company’s offer had been accepted and the railway
payment continued as before. To quote the words of a prominent
member of Parliament: “The Government were giving
an opulent railway company not only a monopoly of the passenger
traffic, but a large subsidy besides, for merely carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the mail bags on their established line of passenger steamers.”
So powerful was the agitation that arose, that the Government
discovered they would not be able to get the contract confirmed
by the House of Commons, the Irish members to a man being
determined to vote against it. The result was the contract was not
brought forward for confirmation, and new tenders were asked
for the Holyhead and Kingstown sea service, special provision
being made for the passenger traffic, which the Government
had ignored on the previous occasion. Greater speed being
desired, the City of Dublin Company tendered for improved
steamers; but the railway company, who had no intention of
going to Kingstown, did not compete, and the City of Dublin
Company were successful in obtaining a contract for twelve
years certain, the subsidy being £84,000 per annum. The four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
mail packets—the <span class="smcap">Ulster</span>, <span class="smcap">Leinster</span>, <span class="smcap">Munster</span>, and <span class="smcap">Connaught</span>—were
provided with new boilers and improved
machinery, and their passenger accommodation was remodelled
and greatly enlarged.</p>

<p>The new service began on the 1st October, 1885, with this
most remarkable result, that vessels after twenty-five years’
service had their speed increased by an average of 2½ knots per
hour. A new steamer was added to the fleet—the <span class="smcap">Ireland</span>,
a vessel capable of steaming 20 knots an hour, being the fastest
paddle steamer ever built for cross-Channel service. The new
service gave much satisfaction to the public, and the passenger
receipts steadily increased. In 1893 the company decided to
build a new type of passenger and cargo vessel, and in the
following year the <span class="smcap">Louth</span>, a screw steamer of large tonnage and
great power, was put on the station; she was found so satisfactory,
her performance being so regular, and her sea-worthy
qualities so good, that she dispelled the great prejudice which
up to that time had existed against screw steamers for cross-Channel
trade (especially the cattle trade), and the company
decided to replace their fleet with steamers of this class. While
this re-construction was going on an attempt was made to
deprive the company of their position on the Holyhead station.
Owing largely to the efforts of the company, Kingstown had
been put in direct communication with all the Irish railway
companies, and the one blot on the Kingstown service removed.
It was stated, however, that the boats were not fast enough, and
the Government were urged to terminate the mail contract and
seek for new tenders.</p>

<p>Most extravagant ideas seemed to prevail as to what could
be done; accelerations were suggested by land and sea which
could not have been accomplished except at very great expense.
However, the City of Dublin Company were not behindhand,
and they put in a variety of tenders, and offered to build boats
of the very largest class. No other company tendered in accordance
with the advertisement. The Post Office, however,
did not accept any of the tenders, and subsequently entered
into negotiations with the company, and settled the existing
contract. The company undertook to build four twin-screw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
steamers, which, although not so large as those originally
proposed, are superior to anything up to the present time
attempted for cross-Channel purposes, and being twin-screws,
their accommodation is far greater than had they been paddle
steamers of the same size. They all realised a speed of 24
knots on their trial trips, which up to the present time has not
been surpassed by any passenger steamer.</p>

<p>The new service commenced on the 1st April, 1897, and
passengers are conveyed between all parts of England and
Ireland at a very high rate of speed, and perform the journey
with a degree of comfort that would have been thought incredible
a few years since.</p>

<p>The fleet of the company now consists of the following high-class
powerful screw steamers, replete with everything necessary
for the comfort of passengers, as well as being equipped
with the most modern appliances for the safe carriage of
cattle and the rapid handling of cargo:—The <span class="smcap">Ulster</span>,
<span class="smcap">Munster</span>, <span class="smcap">Leinster</span>, and <span class="smcap">Connaught</span>, sailing twice each day
from Holyhead and from Kingstown with the mails and passengers.
The <span class="smcap">Carlow</span>, <span class="smcap">Kerry</span>, <span class="smcap">Wicklow</span>, <span class="smcap">Louth</span>, and <span class="smcap">Cork</span>,
sailing every evening to and from Liverpool and Dublin, with
goods and passengers, as well as a morning service from both
ports, with passengers and fast traffic. In the present year
(1903) the Company has placed the <span class="smcap">Kilkenny</span> on the station, a
vessel of an entirely new design, one of the finest passenger and
cargo steamers which has ever been built for the Irish cross-Channel
trade. A service is also maintained three times a
week between Dublin and Belfast by the company’s steamers.</p>

<p>For upwards of three-quarters of a century this grand old
company has faithfully served the public, with an immunity
from loss of life as remarkable as it is gratifying to those
chiefly concerned.</p>

THE BRITISH AND IRISH STEAM PACKET<br>
COMPANY, LIMITED.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The oldest deep-sea steamship passenger trade in Europe is that
between Dublin and London. The distinction of having been
the first persons (other than the crew) to cross the Irish Sea by
steam vessel is shared by Mr. and Mrs. C. R. Weld. Mr. Weld,
who was the Secretary—or brother to the Secretary—of the
Royal Society of Dublin, embarked with his wife on board the
steampacket <span class="smcap">Thames</span>, Captain Dodd, which vessel sailed from
Dublin at noon on the 28th May, 1815, bound for London.</p>

<p>The sailing of this, the first, steamer between Dublin and
London, was an event of the greatest interest to the citizens of
the former city, who assembled in thousands to witness her
departure. It was not intended that the <span class="smcap">Thames</span> should ply
between the two ports, and, as a matter of fact, it was not until
after an interval of eleven years (1826) that a regular steampacket
service was established between the Metropolis of
England and that of Ireland. In the latter year, two of the
City of Dublin Steam Packet Co.’s steamers, the <span class="smcap">Thames</span> (not
the <span class="smcap">Thames</span> of 1815) and the <span class="smcap">Shannon</span> commenced to trade
regularly between Dublin and London.</p>

<p>Amongst other famous steamers, employed on this station,
may be mentioned the <span class="smcap">William Fawcett</span>, which traded
between London and Dublin during the summer of 1829. This
steamer afterwards became the property of the Peninsular Steam
Navigation Co., and is stated in Whitaker’s Almanac (and elsewhere)
to have been the pioneer steamer of the “P. &amp; O. Co.”
In August, 1830, the steampacket <span class="smcap">City of Londonderry</span>,
built in 1827 for the Liverpool and Londonderry trade, and
purchased in October, 1829, by the City of Dublin Co., was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
placed by her new owners on the London station. These three
steamers, the <span class="smcap">Thames</span>, <span class="smcap">Shannon</span> and <span class="smcap">City of Londonderry</span>,
were described in the Company’s advertisement of the
period as being amongst the largest steamers afloat, and all of
the same capacity and power, viz., 513 tons burthen, and 160
h.p. each. These steamers maintained a regular weekly service
(one of them sailing from London every Sunday, calling at
Plymouth), and were due at Dublin in ordinary weather, in 80
hours after leaving London.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>Travelling at that period was expensive, as shown by the
rates charged by these small wooden steamers, compared with
those now charged by the magnificent modern steamships of
the B. and I. Co. of 1,400 to 1,500 tons each.</p>

<p>The present British and Irish Steampacket Company was
established in 1836. The list of the earliest Directors contained
the names of several of the best known citizens of Dublin, the
following being the names of the Directors for the year 1838,
viz.:—Messrs. James Ferrier, John MacDonnell, William
Williams, Francis Carleton, Joseph Boyce, John Jameson, and
John Ennis. The Company’s first fleet consisted of three
wooden paddle steamers, named respectively, <span class="smcap">City of Limerick</span>,
<span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>, and <span class="smcap">Shannon</span>.</p>

<p>A very ingenious robbery from the Company took place at the
St. Katherine’s Docks. Two boxes of gold dust, of a gross
value of £5,245, were landed at Falmouth, ex H.M. Packet
<span class="smcap">Seagull</span>, from the Brazils. From Falmouth they were shipped
per B. and I. steamer <span class="smcap">City of Limerick</span> to the Company’s
Wharf, London, consigned to the Brazilian Mining Co. At
noon on Monday, 29th April, 1839, a person claimed the two
boxes, and presented an order for them, apparently in the same
handwriting as the letter of advice received with the two boxes
from Falmouth. The advice stated that the boxes were only to
be delivered to a gentleman who would call on Monday with a
letter in the same handwriting. The “gentleman” accurately
described the marks, and took away the boxes; but two hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
afterwards, another person, connected with the Brazilian
Mining Co., came for the boxes, and the fraud was then discovered,
for the genuine documents and letter addressed to the
Company by the Falmouth Agent were produced.</p>

<p>Two months later, the whole of the criminals concerned were
in custody, and charged with their offence at the Central
Criminal Court. Two of them, Moss and Solomons, turned
Queen’s evidence. Lewin Caspar (who had been for eighteen
months in the service of the B. and I. Co. as General Superintendent),
was detained in custody until sentence was pronounced,
3rd February, 1840, and was then acquitted, owing to
a flaw in the indictment. His father, Ellis Caspar, and
Emmanuel Moses, were each sentenced to be transported for
14 years, and sailed for Sydney on the 20th October, 1840, on
the convict transport, <span class="smcap">Lord Lynedoch</span>. Alice Abrahams
(daughter of Emmanuel Moses) was also convicted of being an
accomplice, and was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.
Mr. James Hartley (founder of the firm of James Hartley &amp; Co.,
London) rendered very valuable service to the proprietors by his
energy and skill in tracing and successfully prosecuting the
thieves. Mr. James Hartley was elected a Director in 1838,
and for his services in connection with the prosecution of the
gold dust thieves, he was presented with a valuable piece of
plate.</p>

<p>In 1842, the steamship <span class="smcap">Duke of Cornwall</span> was built,
and added to the fleet in order to meet the increased demands
of the trade. Like her sister ships, she was a wooden paddle
steamer, and the last of this type of craft employed in the
service.</p>

<p>The British and Irish Steam Packet Co. were amongst the
first steamship owners to recognise the advantage (now universally
admitted) of the screw propeller over the paddle wheel as
a means for propelling steamships, and in 1845 they introduced
into the London and Dublin trade two schooner-rigged
auxiliary screw steamers, one of which was called the <span class="smcap">Rose</span>,
and the other the <span class="smcap">Shamrock</span>. Three years later the B. and
I. Co. had to encounter a fierce and powerful opposition,
engineered by the Messrs. Malcomson, of Waterford, but which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
involved nearly all the leading Steamship Companies on the
East Coast of Ireland; the B. and I.; Belfast (Langtry’s); City
of Dublin; Cork; and Waterford Steamship Companies all
taking part in the contest. The Waterford Steamship Company
placed steamers on the London and Dublin station, and
the Directors of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company
retaliated by placing steamers on the Waterford and London,
Waterford and Liverpool, and London and St. Petersburg lines.
The opposition lasted until April, 1851, when an arrangement
was come to, whereby the Dublin and London traffic was divided
between Messrs. Malcomson (Waterford Co.) and the B. and I.,
and at the same time the City of Dublin Co. withdrew from
their official connection with the latter Company. In the
meantime, several steamers had been built of iron (notably the
<span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>), and had proved by the severest tests the
great merits of that metal as a material for shipbuilding. So
convinced were the Directors of the B. and I. of the advantages
to be gained by the substitution of iron for wood, that they purchased
in 1850 the first iron paddle steamer of the fleet. This
steamer was named the <span class="smcap">Foyle</span>, and was one of the finest vessels
afloat in her time.</p>

<p>The following year witnessed an extension of the Company’s
operations, a regular service being established between Liverpool,
South of England ports, and London; and also between
Limerick and London. The latter was maintained by the
auxiliary screw steamer <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, and when this vessel was sold
in 1852, the service was discontinued.</p>

<p>To meet the increased requirements of the trade, two large
screw steamers, the <span class="smcap">Lady Eglinton</span> and the <span class="smcap">Nile</span>, were added
to the fleet in 1852.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, two of the
B. and I. steamers, one of which was the new steamer <span class="smcap">Lady
Eglinton</span>, and the other the <span class="smcap">Foyle</span>, were chartered by the
Government for the conveyance of troops and stores. In
consequence of the withdrawal of these two steamers from the
Company’s service, and of the loss of the <span class="smcap">Nile</span> off the Cornish
Coast, the Liverpool to London sailings were abandoned.</p>

<p>In addition to her Government service in the Black Sea, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
<span class="smcap">Lady Eglinton</span>, in 1858, was employed for a short time as
a Trans-Atlantic liner, making, in this capacity, two trips from
Galway to Quebec and Montreal. In 1865, this famous steamer
was placed in the hands of Messrs. Walpole, Webb &amp; Bewley,
shipbuilders, Dublin, by whom she was lengthened thirty feet.</p>

<p>Prior to the declaration of War between the Northern and
Southern States of America, in 1861, the B. and I. Co. had
maintained a regular service between Dublin and Wexford.
The vessel employed in this service was a small paddle steamer
named the <span class="smcap">Mars</span>. In 1863 the <span class="smcap">Mars</span> was sold, crossed the
Atlantic, and began the exciting career of a blockade runner.</p>

<p>Two years later (1865) the <span class="smcap">Lady Wodehouse</span> was built
in Dublin, for the Company, by Messrs. Walpole, Webb and
Bewley, and in 1869 the same builders launched another B. and
I. liner, the <span class="smcap">Countess of Dublin</span>. The year 1870 saw an
important and advantageous change in the fortunes of the
Company, who purchased the interest and steamers of Messrs.
Malcomson’s London-Dublin line, since which time the sea
trade between Dublin and London has been entirely in the
hands of the British and Irish Company. The vessels purchased
from Messrs. Malcomson were the <span class="smcap">Avoca</span> and <span class="smcap">Cymba</span>. In
1879, the B. and I. Company was registered as a Limited
Company, and a new steamer, the <span class="smcap">Lady Olive</span>, 1,096 tons,
was added to the fleet. The <span class="smcap">Lady Olive</span> was the last iron
vessel built for the Company, and the last of the compound
engine type of steamer. All her successors—the present
vessels of the fleet—are built of steel, and fitted with triple-expansion
engines. The first ship of the new type was the
<span class="smcap">Lady Martin</span>, of 1,356 tons gross register, built in 1887
by Messrs. Workman &amp; Clark, of Belfast. Her carrying
capacity is much greater than that of any of her predecessors,
and further increase of tonnage has marked all the vessels
added to the fleet since. Her principal dimensions are—Length
269 feet 6 inches, beam 34 feet 2 inches, and depth of
hold 16 feet 4 inches.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">S.S. <span class="smcap">Lady Wolseley</span> leaving Falmouth.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>She was followed in quick succession by the <span class="smcap">Lady Hudson-Kinahan</span>,
built by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, Troon, in
1891; the <span class="smcap">Lady Wolseley</span>, built by the Naval Construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
and Armaments Company, Barrow, in 1894; and the <span class="smcap">Lady
Roberts</span>, built by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, Troon,
in 1897. The last-named four steamers now carry on the trade
between the two capitals, the <span class="smcap">Lady Olive</span> acting as stand-by
ship. In their main features, all the vessels are very similar,
and vary only slightly in size and power, from the <span class="smcap">Lady
Martin</span>, of 1,365 tons, to the <span class="smcap">Lady Roberts</span>, of 1,462
tons. It will be seen from the particulars given, that the
steamers of the B. and I. Co. are amongst the largest coasting
vessels in the United Kingdom. The average berthing accommodation
of each vessel is—120 saloon and 50 second cabin, in
addition to steerage passengers. Each vessel is fitted up on the
most approved plan, and electrically lighted throughout. Deck
cabins and state rooms can be secured at a small extra charge.
Smoking rooms are also provided, as well as bathrooms. In
the summer season pianos are put on board, and a full complement
of stewards and stewardesses is carried. Under ordinary
circumstances the vessels average 13 knots per hour, which is
quite fast enough for the requirements of the trade; and it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
be mentioned that they are well able to hold their own with the
majority of channel steamers. Any person travelling by these
steamers will find that very few vessels will pass them, and
those which do are probably some crack mail packets running
short passages.</p>

<p>The ships of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company
are as well-known at Falmouth, Plymouth, Southampton, and
Portsmouth as they are at the terminal ports of London and
Dublin. Being so well-found, roomy, comfortable, and up-to-date,
and calling in at all the principal southern ports, it is but
natural that they should be favourites with the holiday-making
and touring public. So favourably are they held in this respect
that during the “fine weather” months they seldom leave port
without having a full complement of passengers, of whom (as
has been stated) they are designed to carry a large number.</p><br>

THE BIBBY LINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Reference has been made, in a previous chapter of this work,
to this old-established firm. It was engaged in shipping in
1807, five years before the first British steamboat was launched.
At that early date the fleet consisted of small sailing vessels,
but in 1821 a regular line of ships to the East Indies was
established. Of the old Liverpool shipowning firms which
had their flag signal posts on Bidston Hill, only three now
remain, viz., Messrs. Bibby, Brocklebank, and Sandbach
Tinne.</p>

<p>In 1851 the firm, then under the guidance of the late Mr.
James J. Bibby, went into the steam trade, their first boats,
the <span class="smcap">Tiber</span> and <span class="smcap">Arno</span>, being built on the Clyde by John Reid
and Co.</p>

<p>Mr. Bibby, in 1859, commenced entrusting the building of
the steamers of the line to Messrs. Harland and Wolff, and
from that date every succeeding vessel has been constructed
by the same firm. It may be interesting to recall that the
late Sir Edward Harland, who was the son of a personal friend
of Mr. Bibby, commenced operations at Belfast with the order
for the <span class="smcap">Sicilian</span>, <span class="smcap">Venetian</span> and <span class="smcap">Syrian</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Bibby adopted the system of building his boats on
commission, a system which ensures the greatest co-operation
between builder and owner, and by which he secured the
greatest advantage wherever his interests were concerned.</p>

<p>The three boats last named were followed by the <span class="smcap">Egyptian</span>
in 1861. All of these vessels carried clipper bows with figure
heads and bowsprits, but the succeeding ships were built with
straight stems, an innovation, the credit of which (and of
many other improvements now generally adopted) is due to Mr.
Bibby. The <span class="smcap">Iberian</span>, <span class="smcap">Illyrian</span> and <span class="smcap">Istrian</span>, all built in
1867, were the first of the fleet to carry the new type of bow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>and they were followed by a long succession of well-known
names, leading up to the present steamers on the Colombo and
Rangoon and Southern Indian route.</p><br>

<p>This service, which was established in 1891, quickly became
prominent among the fast passenger services, and, as such,
was early recognised by the Government and placed on
the list of the special lines available for officers, etc., returning
at the expiration of their leave.</p>

<p>The pioneer vessel of the new service was the <span class="smcap">Yorkshire</span>,
and her sister ship the <span class="smcap">Lancashire</span> (though both somewhat
smaller than the later boats), still holds the blue ribbon of the
route, having steamed from Liverpool to Rangoon in the fastest
time yet on record. The <span class="smcap">Cheshire</span> and <span class="smcap">Shropshire</span>, which
were the next steamers added to the fleet were each about
1,500 tons larger than their immediate predecessors. They
were provided with two entirely distinct and separate sets of
engines and propellers, a fact which at once arrested attention
in the East, and greatly added to the popularity which their
other arrangements justified. Intending passengers will be
interested to know that with only one propeller in use, they
are capable of making as good progress as an ordinary trading
steamer.</p>

<p>After an interval of two years (1893) the twin-screw steamer
<span class="smcap">Staffordshire</span> was built, and in her was embodied every
improvement which experience and money could provide.
She was at once generally acknowledged to be the most comfortable
and the best ventilated type of steamer placed on the
Eastern route.</p>

<p>In October, 1897, the twin-screw steamer <span class="smcap">Derbyshire</span> was
added to the fleet. She is designed on the same lines as the
<span class="smcap">Staffordshire</span> but being 7 feet longer and 3 feet broader, her
staterooms are somewhat larger. An important addition was
made to the fleet in 1902, when the twin-screw steamer <span class="smcap">Warwickshire</span>
was built. Her advent on the line was looked
forward to with much interest, and she has amply fulfilled all
anticipations, and has secured a preference over any other
steamer for first-class passengers between Ceylon and Europe.
Her large size admits of 200 berths being fitted, and the Main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Saloon, Drawing room, Smoke room, Bath room, etc., are all
increased in their proportions.</p>

<p>By an ingenious arrangement (which is quite novel) every
stateroom has a port opening to the outside of the ship, and all
the rooms are equally light and airy, while many of the rooms
provided are fitted up for the accommodation of one or two
passengers only. The <span class="smcap">Warwickshire</span> has marked a new era
in the equipment of large passenger steamers, and the above
mentioned Bibby Patent Stateroom is now being adopted by
the principal Mail Lines in the construction of new boats. A
twin-screw steamer, to be named the <span class="smcap">Worcestershire</span>, is now
under construction at Belfast. She is designed closely on the
lines of the <span class="smcap">Warwickshire</span>, and is expected to be completed
in good time to enable her to take her place in the Autumn
sailings of 1904.</p>

<p>The steamers of the Bibby Line sail on alternate Thursdays
from Liverpool, calling at Marseilles to embark the overland
passengers on the following Thursday. Circular tickets in
connection with these sailings are issued for £15, which are
available for a passage both ways by any steamer of the fleet,
or if passengers prefer it, they will receive, free of additional
cost, a first-class Railway ticket, via Paris, for the journey
one way overland to or from London.</p>

<p>Travellers to and from Egypt, Palestine, etc., whether
journeying round Spain or using the Marseilles route will
find these steamers a convenient and luxurious means of
conveyance.</p>

<p>The public will be glad to know that passages can be secured
for £3 3s. for the fortnightly runs round from London to
Liverpool. The steamers usually leave Tilbury on Friday,
and arrive in Liverpool on the following Monday morning, thus
affording a very pleasant week end trip.</p>

THE CORK STEAMSHIP COMPANY, LIMITED.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Cork Steamship Company, as successors to the St. George
Steam Packet Co., may justly be considered to be one of the
oldest existing steamship companies in the world. The original
company (the St. George), was formed in the Autumn of the
year 1821, its headquarters being in Liverpool. An announcement
concerning it appeared in the Liverpool “Mercury,” of
the 12th October, 1821, stating:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A company has been formed here (Liverpool) for
establishing steam packets.... Two vessels of large
dimensions are already contracted for, and are now
building by two experienced ship-builders in this town,
the machinery for both to be fitted by an engineer of
eminence; and the proprietors, we learn, are determined
to spare no expense in the equipment of the vessels to
contribute to the safety and comfort of the passengers.”</p>
</div>

<p>In accordance with this announcement the pioneer steam
packet of the Company, the <span class="smcap">St. Patrick</span>, was launched from
the yard of Mr. Thomas Wilson, Liverpool, at 10-30 a.m.
on the 21st April following.</p>

<p>This event created quite a sensation in the town, as she was,
if not the first steamer ever built in the port, certainly the
finest specimen of ship-building craft up to that date constructed
there. So great was the interest displayed that every
wall and pier from which a view of the launch could be
obtained was crowded with spectators. This steamer ran for
about two years between various ports in England and Ireland,
and having in that time established a reputation for speed and
seaworthiness, she was purchased by a London Company to
trade between London and Lisbon. She was replaced by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
second <span class="smcap">St. Patrick</span>, a vessel of 300 tons burthen and 120
h.p., built by Clarke and Nickson, Liverpool, and launched
from their yard on the 19th August, 1825. In the interim
between the dates of the launch of the first and second
<span class="smcap">St. Patrick</span>, the Company had built or purchased quite a
number of steamers. They had also established themselves
in Cork, and had built the premises situated on Penrose Quay,
where to-day is carried on the business of the City of Cork
Steam Packet Co., Limited.</p>

<p>The first three steamers employed by the St. George Co. in
trading to and from Cork, were the <span class="smcap">Lee</span> and <span class="smcap">Severn</span>, both
built in Liverpool in 1825 (the former for the Liverpool trade
and the latter for the Bristol trade), and the <span class="smcap">Superb</span>, built by
Mr. William Evans, London.</p>

<p>The St. George Co. extended its operations with marvellous
rapidity, until its steamers were to be found in almost every
port in the United Kingdom, and in the chief ports of Holland,
Denmark, and Russia. It owned several famous steamers, one
of which, on the authority of Jeffry in “A Century of our Sea
Story,” made the first steam voyage between Great Britain and
Australia. This was the <span class="smcap">Sophia Jane</span>, a vessel of 256 tons
and 50 h.p., built by William Evans, London, and first employed
between London Bridge and Gravesend. When first
placed on this station, her owners were involved in an action
at law to prove their right to navigate the river. They won
their action from the Watermen’s Company, and soon the first
Gravesend Steam Ferry was started. The <span class="smcap">Sophia Jane</span> plied
on the Thames until 1828, when she began to make longer
voyages, running for some months between Portsmouth and
Plymouth, afterwards under the St. George flag, between
Liverpool and Douglas (Isle of Man), later between London
and Calais, and finally made her great voyage from England
to Australia. She arrived at Port Jackson Heads in
May, 1831, three months after leaving the Thames, thus
making the first steam voyage between Great Britain and
Australia, and the longest voyage under steam down almost to
the fifties.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the management of the St. George Co. was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
all that could be desired, and the late Mr. Ebenezer Pike, of
Bessborough, Blackrock, County Cork, convened a meeting of
the shareholders which was held at Cork on the 17th February,
1843. Prior to the meeting, Mr. Pike had forwarded to each
shareholder a copy of a circular in which he proposed (<em>a</em>) to
form a Company with a capital of £50,000 in 1,000 shares of
£50 each; and (<em>b</em>) to build a new steamer of 500 to 600 tons
burthen and 300 h.p.</p>

<p>The circular was discussed at the meeting, but no definite
decision was arrived at. Mr. Pike, however, did not allow the
matter to rest. In October following, so far as Cork was concerned,
the title “St. George” was dropped, and the title “City
of Cork Steamship Co.” (afterwards shortened to “Cork Steamship
Co.”) was adopted in its stead. Mr. William Wilson, the
founder of the firm of Wilson, Son &amp; Co., was the first general
manager at Cork, and Mr. McTear the Liverpool agent. Nor
did Mr. Pike abandon the idea of the new steamer, for on the
26th September, 1843, Messrs. Thomas Vernon &amp; Son built to
his order the steamship <span class="smcap">Nimrod</span>.</p>

<p>The following year the Company was virtually re-constructed,
and the Cork Steamship Co. was formed with a
capital of £170,000, in 1,700 shares of £100 each. The first
Directors were, Messrs. Ebenezer Pike, John Gould, James
Connell, Joseph Hayes, and William Lane, all merchants
belonging to Cork.</p>

<p>At the date of the re-construction of the Company, the St.
George Steam Packet Co. owned about 20 steamers. Most of
them were disposed of to various buyers, the new management
retaining seven, viz., the <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, <span class="smcap">Severn</span>, <span class="smcap">Tiger</span>, <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>,
<span class="smcap">Victory</span>, <span class="smcap">Ocean</span>, and <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lee</span> and <span class="smcap">Severn</span> have already been referred to.
The <span class="smcap">Tiger</span> was a steamer of 389 tons, built at Hull in 1838.
She was 156 feet long, by 26 feet beam, and 18 feet deep. She
was rigged as a two-masted schooner and had a tiger figurehead.
Originally she was intended for the St. George Hull
and Hamburg service; was taken over by the Cork Steamship
Co. in 1844, and sold by them in 1851 to London buyers.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Jupiter</span> was a vessel of 360 tons, built at Greenock in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
1835. Transferred to the Cork Steamship Co. in 1844, and sold
by them to London buyers in 1847.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Victory</span> was a Liverpool built steamer of 256 tons,
built in 1832. The Cork Steamship Co. did not retain
possession of her long, but sold her in 1846 to the Malcomsons
of Waterford, who employed her in their Limerick and
London service.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ebenezer Pike</span>, J.P. (late Chairman Cork Steamship Co.).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ocean</span> was a steamer of 300 tons, her principal
dimensions being 154 by 22 by 15. She was built on the
Mersey in 1836, and in 1838 made a record passage from Liverpool
to Cork in 23 hours. She was intended for the general
Coasting Service of the St. George Co., and had the honour of
acting as tender to her more famous sister-ship the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>, on
the occasion of the latter’s historic voyage to New York. Six
years later when she had become the property of the Cork
Steamship Co., she rendered valuable service to the Steampacket
<span class="smcap">Vanguard</span>, belonging to the Dublin and Glasgow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Steam Packet Co. During a gale on the 14th December, 1844,
the <span class="smcap">Vanguard</span>, inward bound with a valuable cargo and a
number of passengers, was forced on to the rocks about a
quarter of a mile inside of Roche’s Point Lighthouse. This
occurred about 4 a.m., and soon afterwards the <span class="smcap">Ocean</span>, inwards
from Bristol to Cork, passed the spot. The <span class="smcap">Vanguard</span>’s
signals of distress were noticed, and the Captain of the <span class="smcap">Ocean</span>
(Caldbeck), in spite of the heavy sea that was running, at
once launched his boats, and succeeded in rescuing the
<span class="smcap">Vanguard</span>’s passengers. The steamer was afterwards towed
off the rocks and taken to Passage for repairs. The <span class="smcap">Ocean</span>
continued in the service of the Cork Steamship Co. until 1853,
when she was purchased by the Chester and Holyhead Railway
Co. The remaining steamer transferred from the St. George
Co., was the famous <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>. The <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> was built in 1837
by Menzies &amp; Co., Perth, and engined by J. Wingate &amp; Co.,
Glasgow; and cost £27,000. Her length was 208 feet, her
breadth 25 feet, and her depth 18 feet. She had two masts
and one funnel, and a dog figure-head, holding between the
fore-paws a star, representing the dog-star Sirius, after which
the vessel was named. On the occasion of her memorable
voyage to New York, she sailed from London on the 28th
March, 1838, under the command of Lieut. Richard Roberts,
R.N., and called at Cork Harbour to coal and to embark the
mails and passengers. The <span class="smcap">Ocean</span> arrived from Liverpool
on the 3rd April with mails and passengers to be transferred to
the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span>. Next morning at 10 o’clock the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> got
under way, being accompanied as far as the entrance to the
harbour by the <span class="smcap">Ocean</span>. There, a brief stoppage was made
while the <span class="smcap">Ocean</span> went alongside the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> to bring off a
number of ladies and gentlemen who had been permitted to
accompany their friends thus far, the steamers exchanged
salutes, and then the <span class="smcap">Sirius</span> continued her course, being
watched with keen interest until she disappeared beneath the
horizon. She arrived at New York at 10 p.m. on the 22nd
April, and thus brought to a successful termination the first
voyage ever made by a passenger steamer from Europe to
America. She made two Trans-Atlantic voyages, and afterwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>returned to the Home and Continental Services. When
she became the property of the Cork Steamship Co. she was
employed in the Glasgow, Dublin and Cork Service, in which
she continued until 1847. On the evening of the 15th June
of that year, she sailed from Dublin to Cork with a general
cargo, and forty passengers. All went well until 4 a.m. on
the 16th, when she encountered a dense fog, and went on the
rocks in Ballycotton Bay. Twelve passengers and two seamen
were unfortunately drowned by the capsizing of a boat which
had been launched, but the rest of the passengers and crew were
saved by means of a rope which was passed from the ship
to the shore. The vessel itself went to pieces on the 22nd
June.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>Nearly all the steamers retained by the new management
were sold to various owners within a few years from the reconstruction
of the Company, and new and more powerful
vessels substituted for them. The first of these, the <span class="smcap">Nimrod</span>,
was the first iron steamship owned in Cork. She was built
by Thomas Vernon &amp; Son, Liverpool, to Mr. Pike’s order in
1843, and was 177 feet long, 25 feet beam, and 16 feet deep.
Her tonnage was 583 tons, and she had two masts, a clipper
bow, and a huntsman (Nimrod) figurehead.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ajax</span>, a vessel of about 600 tons, was added in 1845,
and the <span class="smcap">Preussischer Adler</span>, of 563 tons, also built in
1845, was purchased by the Company. The latter steamer
was designed as an armed yacht for the late King of Prussia.
She was built at Liverpool, and cost £32,000. She was a
broad-beamed paddle-boat, having a beam of 28 feet, her length
being 185 feet, and her depth 17 feet. She was rigged as a
two masted schooner, with a cutwater, an eagle figurehead.
The Company, after purchase, added to her length, and for this
purpose placed her in the Rushbrook Dry Dock, Cork,
belonging to the Channel Dry Docks and Engineering Co.; the
<span class="smcap">Preussischer Adler</span> being the first steamer to enter this
dock. As originally designed her paddle-boxes were so constructed
as to be capable of being turned down over her sides,
in order that two large swivel guns which she carried on deck,
might have a free range all round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>She remained in the service of the Company until 1884, when
she was broken up in London.</p>

<p>In 1846 Messrs. R. and J. Lecky, of Cork, built a small
screw steamer to the order of the Cork Steamship Co. She was
named the <span class="smcap">Blarney</span>, and was only 118 feet long, 19 feet
broad, and 11 feet deep. Notwithstanding her diminutive
size, she ran for a number of years between Liverpool and
Havre, and was eventually sold to a Liverpool firm in 1854.
It is noteworthy that the <span class="smcap">Blarney</span> was the first cross-channel
steamer built in Cork by R. &amp; J. Lecky, and was the
first screw steamer built for the Cork Steamship Co.</p>

<p>The year 1850 saw the Cork Steamship Co. involved in the
most serious struggle which probably ever occurred in the
coasting steamship trade. It began by the City of Dublin Co.,
at the solicitation of the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway Co.,
running opposition steamers to Waterford. The City of
Dublin Co., in addition to their Liverpool and Dublin Service,
had maintained for many years a regular service of steamers
between Liverpool and Belfast. Mr. Joseph Malcomson
(Waterford Steamship Co.) was a Director of the Cork Steamship
Co., and his firm had a large financial interest in that
Company. It was, therefore, to be expected that these two
Companies would form staunch allies in any struggle, the more
so, when the City of Dublin Co., in conjunction with the
British and Irish Steampacket Co., extended the opposition to
Cork. The Cork and Waterford Steamship Companies carried the
war into their opponents’ territory. They put a steamer on the
station between London and the South and East of Ireland
once a week, between Liverpool and Belfast twice a week, and
between Liverpool and Dublin, daily. The City of Dublin Co.
offered to make contracts with merchants in Cork and Waterford,
undertaking to carry their traffic freight free for three
months, in response to which the Waterford Co. threatened to
place two steamers on the Holyhead and Dublin station in
conjunction with the Chester and Holyhead Railway Co.</p>

<p>The struggle between the various companies was fiercely
maintained for over twelve months, until in April, 1851, upon
the suggestion of Mr. Malcomson, an interview took place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
between a Director of the City of Dublin Steam Packet Co. and
himself (as representing the Cork and Waterford Companies),
at which meeting the companies concerned arrived at an
amicable basis of settlement.</p>

<p>In this settlement the City of Dublin Co. agreed to transfer
their Liverpool and Belfast service to the Cork Steamship Co.
This arrangement held good until 1854. On the 14th January
of the year named a deputation from the Cork and Belfast
Companies met in Dublin. There were present, Mr. Pike
(Managing Director) and Mr. Glover (Secretary), of the Cork
Steamship Co.; Mr. W. R. S. Lepper (Chairman) and Mr.
Valentine, of the Belfast Co. The meeting was conducted in a
most friendly manner, and it was arranged that the <span class="smcap">Telegraph</span>
(Belfast Co.’s steamer) should be at once withdrawn
from the Liverpool and Cork service, and the <span class="smcap">Minerva</span> (Cork
Co.’s steamer) from the Liverpool and Belfast service. The
year 1854 witnessed a great stream of emigrants from Cork.
According to a paragraph in the “Cork Constitution” of that
date:—</p>

<p>“On Saturday, 1st April, the <span class="smcap">Minerva</span> left with 467 adult
emigrants, 79 children, and 8 infants, besides other passengers.
The vessel was so crowded she had to leave 200 passengers
behind. The <span class="smcap">Nimrod</span> leaves every Wednesday, and is
freighted with emigrants to a similar extent. This continual
stream of emigrants has been going on for a considerable time.”</p>

<p>While the war cloud was gathering over Europe, which in
bursting produced the Crimean War, the Cork Steamship Co.
had on the stocks a steamer, afterwards named the <span class="smcap">Cormorant</span>.
In the equipment of this steamer a novel feature had
been introduced, viz., iron masts. These masts, of which she
carried three, were exceptionally tall and graceful, and so well
buckled that not a joint was visible. The whole appearance of
the vessel was so smart that she excited general admiration, and
was selected by the Government as a transport. While she was
lying at Portsmouth, after the embarkation of the 13th Lancers
for the seat of war, Her (late) Majesty Queen Victoria, accompanied
by the Prince Consort, came on board to inspect her
before sailing. After inspecting the troopers’ quarters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
admiring some of their horses, Her Majesty discovered that the
ship’s masts were not wood but iron. She was so impressed
with their graceful appearance that she gave instructions for
full particulars of them to be taken by the Dockyard officials.</p>

<p>Two other steamers of the Company—the <span class="smcap">Dodo</span> (nicknamed
the rolling Dodo) and the <span class="smcap">Albatross</span>—were also engaged
by the Government as transports. At the Crimea, as well as at
home, the <span class="smcap">Cormorant</span>’s masts excited great interest. One
day a Turkish Admiral came on board, and a quartermaster was
told off to show the distinguished visitor round the ship. The
Admiral came to the mainmast, examined it, tapped it, and
turning to his attendant, said:—</p>

<p>“I-ron?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Excellency.”</p>

<p>“Sō-lid?”</p>

<p>“No, you blithering fool; it’s hollow,” was the reply, except
that the adjective used was more forcible than the one we have
given.</p>

<p>Amongst the vessels which were at the Crimea at this time
was an American schooner, the captain of which was very
proud of his craft, and was continually boasting of her beauty
and of the lofty masts she carried. He “challenged creation to
find her ditto.” One day when he was boasting in his usual
strain, Captain Byrne, who was present, said quietly, “What
might the height of your masts be, captain?” “Every inch of
90 feet, I guess,” replied the American. “Well,” said
Captain Byrne, “I can show you a ship with taller masts than
that.” “Where?” “In this harbour, on my ship.”</p>

<p>To settle the dispute the two captains proceeded to the
<span class="smcap">Cormorant</span>. Now it must be confessed that the <span class="smcap">Cormorant</span>’s
masts had not been scraped for some time, and were
so streaked with paint and grease that they might easily be
mistaken for pine. The American captain came to the foot of
the mainmast and looked up. “Great Cæsar! What height
do you call that?”</p>

<p>“120 feet,” replied Captain Byrne.</p>

<p>“Is it all one piece?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“There’s not a splice in it from heel to truck,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“I calculate that timber was raised in Oregon,” said the
American.</p>

<p>“No, it was not.”</p>

<p>“Well, do tell, where did it grow?”</p>

<p>“That, sir,” quoth Captain Byrne, “was raised in Cork.”</p>

<p>A collision occurred on the 10th July, 1866, resulting
in the total loss of H.M.S. <span class="smcap">Amazon</span> and the Cork steamship
<span class="smcap">Osprey</span>, with a number of passengers, chiefly ladies. The
<span class="smcap">Osprey</span> was outward bound from Liverpool to Antwerp, with
a general cargo. She was under the command of the late
Captain Bertridge, and carried a crew of 14 hands. When off
Portland, at 1 o’clock in the morning, the look-out reported a
steamer approaching, which proved to be H.M.S. <span class="smcap">Amazon</span>.
By a fatal error of judgment (for which he was dismissed the
service) on the part of the officer in command, the <span class="smcap">Amazon</span>
crashed into the <span class="smcap">Osprey</span>. While the vessels were locked
together the crew of the Cork steamer scrambled over the bows
of the man-of-war, leaving to Captain Bertridge the task of
saving his family (who were on board) and passengers. These
he placed in one of the boats belonging to the <span class="smcap">Osprey</span>, cut
the lashings, and had barely done so when his steamer sank,
dragging the boat into the whirlpool as it sank, and drowning
all in it, except the captain and one passenger. The captain’s
wife had previously jumped into the sea from the boat, and was
rescued and taken on board the <span class="smcap">Amazon</span>. The latter vessel was so
injured by the collision that she also sank about four hours later,
but all on board took to the boats and were landed at Torquay.</p>

<p>About this period the question of the Company’s house-flag
began to be agitated. The <span class="smcap">Cormorant</span>, under Captain Croft,
was lying at Penrose Quay, with her house-flag floating
from the masthead. A section of the Channel Fleet happened
to be in port at the time, and Captain Croft was surprised to
receive a message from the Admiral commanding, asking why
the <span class="smcap">Cormorant</span> was flying his (the Admiral’s) flag. Captain
Croft replied that the flag he carried had been his Company’s
house-flag for the last twenty years, and of his Company’s
predecessor for over twenty years before that. To this the
Admiral very courteously replied that he personally would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>interfere with the use of the flag, but that as the Government
had adopted it as an Admiral’s flag, it was possible that some
difficulties might arise later.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Rissa</span> S.S. Cork Steamship Company.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The question of the flag was next raised at Bussorah, in the
Persian Gulf, on the 7th November, 1882. The <span class="smcap">Dotterel</span>
had finished loading, and was getting ready for sea, when a
message came from H.M.S. <span class="smcap">Dryad</span>, which was in the roadstead,
asking why the <span class="smcap">Dotterel</span> dared to carry the Admiral’s
flag, and stating it must be pulled down at once.</p>

<p>“Tell your commander,” said Captain Dobson, “that that
flag is my Company’s house-flag, and that I will not lower it
without instructions from my owners.”</p>

<p>The boat went back with this message, and Captain Dobson
immediately sent a man aloft to grease the backstays and the
masthead, having first nailed the flag to it.</p>

<p>In a short time the boat returned with a petty officer, whose
instructions were, if the master of the <span class="smcap">Dotterel</span> did not
lower the flag, he was to send one of his men aloft to do so.
“All right,” said Captain Dobson. “I shan’t pull my flag
down; you can do what you please.” The officer turned to his
men and gave his orders. One tar after another tried to shin
up the mast without success, and after several attempts the
officer had to return and report the failure of his mission, and
the <span class="smcap">Dotterel</span> proceeded to sea.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The commander of the man-of-war having reported to the
Admiralty, a correspondence ensued between that Department
of the Government and the Cork Steamship Co., resulting in
the Company placing a blue star in the centre of the St.
George’s Cross on a white ensign, which now constitutes the
distinguishing house-flag of that Company.</p>

<p>In 1871 the business of the Cork Steamship Co. had increased
to such an extent, it was considered desirable to separate the
coasting from the foreign services, and to form two distinct
companies. This was accordingly done, the former being registered
under the title of the City of Cork Steam Packet Co., Ltd.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
and the latter under the style of the Cork Steamship Co., Ltd.
Mr. Ebenezer Pike died in the year 1883, and was succeeded by
his son, Mr. Joseph Pike, of Dunsland, co. Cork, as Chairman
and Managing Director of the Company.</p>

<p>When the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894, one
of the first foreign trading steamers to pass through the canal
was the <span class="smcap">Ibis</span>, belonging to the Cork Steamship Co. The Cork
Steamship Co.’s steamer <span class="smcap">Lestris</span> was the first steamer to
enter Flushing Docks on the 8th September, 1873, being
locked in with the King of Holland’s yacht.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>The later years of the Company have been unproductive of
historical incidents, perhaps not altogether to the regret of the
shareholders. The older steamers have been disposed of from
time to time, and replaced by modern steamers of larger
tonnage and greater power. Instead of steamers of 500 to 600
tons, the fleet at the present time (1903) consists of 16 powerful
vessels, varying from 1,000 to 2,400 tons.</p>

THE CUNARD STEAMSHIP COMPANY,<br>
LIMITED.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It seems incredible that less than three-quarters of a century
ago steamers were unknown on the Atlantic. The mail-boats
of that date were wretched old Government 10-gun “coffin
brigs,” slow and uncertain in their passages. But there were
men, even in those days, who dreamed of a time to come when
steamers should cross the ocean with the regularity, though
not with the speed, of railway trains. Amongst these
enthusiasts was Mr. Samuel Cunard, a shipowner of Halifax,
Nova Scotia. For years he had striven to realise his idea, but
not having sufficient capital of his own, and not being able to
induce his friends to invest in his enterprise, he had to wait his
opportunity. At last the long-waited-for opportunity came,
and he seized it. The British Admiralty issued a circular
stating that the mails would be transferred to a steam packet
service, if a satisfactory tender were sent in. When this
circular came into the hands of Mr. Cunard he again appealed
to the merchants of Halifax and others for assistance; and
being unsuccessful in his application he came to Britain
and fortunately became acquainted with Mr. R. Napier. Mr.
Napier introduced him to Mr. George Burns who, in his turn,
introduced him to Mr. David MacIver, of Liverpool. In the
course of a few days, chiefly through the influence of Mr. Burns,
the requisite capital, £270,000, was obtained, and soon afterwards
a contract for seven years between the Government and
Samuel Cunard, George Burns and David MacIver was signed,
and the Cunard Steamship Co. was launched. Before their
arrangements were finally adjusted, the Admiralty re-modelled
the agreement, requiring that the service should be performed
by four suitable steamers (instead of three, as originally stated),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>and that fixed dates of sailing should be adhered to, but in
consideration of the increased services the subsidy was raised
from £60,000 to £81,000.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2220_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent">R.M.S. <span class="smcap">Campania</span> (Cunard Steamship Company) at Liverpool Landing Stage.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The official title of the Company was “The British and North
American Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.,” but this unwieldy
title soon gave place to one of world-wide reputation, “The
Cunard Line.”</p>

<p>The first steamer despatched by the co-partnery was one of
Messrs. Burns’ Liverpool and Glasgow steamers, the <span class="smcap">Unicorn</span>.
She sailed from Liverpool for Halifax and Boston, under the
command of Captain Douglas, on Saturday morning, 16th May,
1840. She carried the mails and a limited number of saloon
passengers, the passage rates being—to Halifax £30, to Boston
£33 each. The <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, the pioneer steamer of the
British and North American Steam Packet Co., was
despatched on the 4th July, 1840, being the first of
four wooden paddle-wheel steamships, the others being the
<span class="smcap">Acadia</span>, <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span> and <span class="smcap">Columbia</span>. These vessels were uniform
in size and power, being 207 feet long, 34 feet 4 inches broad,
and 22 feet 6 inches deep. Their gross tonnage was 1,154 tons,
and their engines of 740 I.H.P. drove them at an average speed
of 8½ knots per hour. The reception given to the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>
on the termination of her maiden voyage by the citizens of
Boston was most enthusiastic. Nor was the goodwill of the
merchants confined to banquets and complimentary speeches
for, when the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> was ice-bound in Boston Harbour, in
February, 1844, they liberated her by cutting a canal through
the ice, seven miles long and 100 feet wide.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>In 1843 the Company added to their fleet the <span class="smcap">Hibernia</span>, and in
1845 the <span class="smcap">Cambria</span>, each of 1,040 I.H.P. and of 1,422 tons gross,
with an average speed of 9¼ knots. On the expiration of the
Postal Contract the Government stipulated that the existing
mail service should be doubled, that the steamers of the Company
should be capable of carrying guns of the largest calibre, and
that a steamer should leave Liverpool every Saturday (calling
at Holyhead if required) for New York and Boston alternately;
the Boston steamer to call at Halifax, and the New York
steamer to do so also, if required by the Lords Commissioners of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>the Admiralty. In consideration of these augmented services
the annual subsidy was increased to £173,340, at which figure
it remained for twenty years (1847 to 1867). To meet the new
requirements, the <span class="smcap">America</span>, <span class="smcap">Niagara</span>, <span class="smcap">Canada</span> and <span class="smcap">Europa</span>, of
1,825 tons, and 2,000 I.H.P., with an average speed of ten and
a quarter knots, were built and added to the fleet. A few years
later the Collins Line, heavily subsidised, was started with the
avowed object of “sweeping the Cunarders off the Atlantic.”
This opposition lasted until 1858, when, having lost two ships,
and being refused any further subsidy by the United States
Government, the Collins Company collapsed, and the remaining
ships were withdrawn. During the continuance of this opposition
the Cunard Company added steadily to their fleet larger
and more powerful steamers. The <span class="smcap">Asia</span> and <span class="smcap">Africa</span> were built
in 1850, and were each 266 feet by 40 feet by 27·2 feet, of
2,226 tons gross, with engines of 2,400 I.H.P., and of an average
speed of 12·5 knots. These were followed in 1852 by the
<span class="smcap">Arabia</span>, the last of the wooden paddle steamers. She was 285
feet long, 40 feet 8 inches broad, and 29 feet deep. Her
engines indicated 3,250 H.P., and her average speed was 13
knots per hour. Three years later, 1855, the first iron mail
steamship was built for the Cunard Company. She was named
the <span class="smcap">Persia</span>, and was nearly one hundred feet longer than the
largest of her predecessors. Her principal dimensions were—Length
376 feet, breadth 45 feet 3 inches, depth 31 feet 6 inches.
Her gross tonnage was 4,000 tons, and her engines indicated
4,000 H.P., giving a speed of 13·8 knots per hour. In 1853 the
Company established (primarily as auxiliaries to their Atlantic
service) branch lines between Liverpool and Havre, and Liverpool
and the principal ports in the Mediterranean, Adriatic,
Levant, Bosphorus, and Black Sea. For these branch lines the
screw steamers <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>, <span class="smcap">Australian</span>, <span class="smcap">Andes</span> and <span class="smcap">Alps</span> were
built in 1852, followed by the <span class="smcap">Jura</span> in 1854 and the <span class="smcap">Etna</span> in
1855. War having been declared against Russia the four last-named
steamers, in addition to the <span class="smcap">Cambria</span>, <span class="smcap">Niagara</span>, <span class="smcap">Europa</span>
and <span class="smcap">Arabia</span>, were engaged by the Government as troopships.
The Cunard Company had in 1854 purchased the steamer <span class="smcap">Emeu</span>,
and she was immediately chartered to the Government. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span><span class="smcap">Emeu</span> was the first troopship to arrive out at the commencement
of the Crimean War, and in the seventeen months following she
conveyed upwards of 17,000 troops to the Crimea. A few years
later (1862) the famous <span class="smcap">Scotia</span> (the last of the paddle-wheel
steamers) was built. In 1878 she was sold to the Telegraph
Construction Company, who converted her into a screw steamer.
The same year (1862) the Cunard Company ordered their first
screw steamer for the Atlantic trade. This was the <span class="smcap">China</span>
S.S., now converted into a four-masted barque and named the
<span class="smcap">Theodor</span>. She was followed in 1864 by the <span class="smcap">Cuba</span>, in 1865 by
the <span class="smcap">Java</span>, and in 1867 by the <span class="smcap">Russia</span>, of 2,960 tons gross and
3,100 I.H.P. After sailing for many years under the Cunard
Flag, the <span class="smcap">Russia</span> was sold to the “American Line.” Her new
owners lengthened her, gave her a fourth mast, and altered her
name to the <span class="smcap">Waesland</span>. She finally sank off Holyhead, after
colliding with the S.S. <span class="smcap">Harmonides</span>, on the 5th March, 1902.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>The Company’s Postal Contract having expired on the 31st
December, 1867, a new contract was entered into with the
Postmaster-General for one year, whereby the Cunard Company
undertook to despatch a steamer from Liverpool to New
York, calling at Queenstown, returning from New York
every Wednesday, also calling at Queenstown. The payment
for this service was £80,000, which sum was further reduced the
following year to £70,000 per annum for several years. Under
the last contract, which was for the period named, the Company
guaranteed to sail a steamer from Liverpool (calling at Queenstown)
to Boston every Tuesday, in addition to the mail service
from Liverpool to New York every Saturday. The last-mentioned
contract expired on the 31st December, 1876, on
which date a new system of postal remuneration came into
operation based on the amount of correspondence carried per
voyage, under which system the Cunard Company has carried
the mails to the present time. It will thus be seen that the
continuity of their mail service has continued unbroken for
upwards of sixty years. The invention of compound engines
was the latest evolution of marine engineering engaging attention
in 1869-70. The Directors of the Cunard Company quickly
realised that the saving effected by the use of compound engines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>was so considerable, without reduction of speed, that their
adoption was an imperative necessity. This decision was
arrived at too late to furnish with the new style of engines the
<span class="smcap">Abyssinia</span> and <span class="smcap">Algeria</span>, each of about 3,300 tons and 2,480
I.H.P., just completed by Messrs. J. &amp; G. Thomson, and
placed on the New York station; but the <span class="smcap">Batavia</span>, then on
the stocks to the order of another company, was purchased and
supplied with machinery on the new principle; and an order
was given to the same builders (Messrs. Denny, Dumbarton) for
a similar vessel of rather larger tonnage to be named the
<span class="smcap">Parthia</span>. A further extension of the Company’s business took
place in 1872, by the establishment of a direct line of steamers
between the Clyde and the West Indies. The <span class="smcap">Trinidad</span> and
the <span class="smcap">Demerara</span>, two sister ships of about 2,000 tons each, were
built that year, and placed on the station, but after about twelve
months’ trading they were withdrawn, and sent to supplement
the Company’s service in the Mediterranean. During the
succeeding six years the fleet was increased by the addition of
seven large steamers, all fitted with compound engines, the last
and largest of which was the <span class="smcap">Gallia</span>, of 4,809 tons and 5,300
I.H.P.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2280_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>

<p>In 1878 it was considered expedient to consolidate the
interests of the partners by registering the Company under the
Limited Liability Acts, and a Joint Stock Company was formed
with a capital of £2,000,000, of which £1,200,000 was issued
and taken up by the families of Cunard, Burns and MacIver.
No shares were offered to the public until 1880, when a prospectus
was issued intimating that “it was now proposed to issue
the balance of the capital.” The available shares were rapidly
subscribed for, the representatives of the three founders retaining
a large financial interest in the Company. About this
period steel was engaging the attention of shipbuilders as a
substitute for iron. The Cunard Directors were so convinced
of the superiority of the former, especially where speed was a
desideratum, that they ordered a steel steamship from Messrs.
J. &amp; G. Thomson, to be larger and more powerful than any
steamer previously built, the <span class="smcap">Great Eastern</span> alone excepted.
This monster vessel, which was named the <span class="smcap">Servia</span>, was completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
in 1881. Her dimensions were—Length 515 feet,
breadth 52<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet, depth 37 feet. Her gross tonnage was 7,392.
Her engines were compound—with seven steel boilers—and
developed 10,000 I.H.P., producing a speed of 17 knots per
hour. She was fitted in the most substantial and beautiful
manner for the accommodation of 480 cabin and 750 steerage
passengers, and embodied all the most modern appliances
conducive to comfort and safety. She was the first of the
Cunard Fleet to be equipped with incandescent electric lamps.
The same year, the <span class="smcap">Catalonia</span>, 4,841 tons and 3,200 I.H.P., was
built for the Boston service, and two more for the same service
in the following year. These were the <span class="smcap">Pavonia</span>, of 5,587 tons
and 4,000 I.H.P., built by Messrs. J. &amp; G. Thomson; and the
<span class="smcap">Cephalonia</span>, 5,517 tons and 4,000 I.H.P., by Messrs. Laird
Brothers, Birkenhead.</p>

<p>A second steel steamship was built in 1883 for the New York
Mail Service. This was the <span class="smcap">Aurania</span>, built by Messrs. J. &amp; G.
Thomson, and her dimensions are 470 feet by 57<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet by
37<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet. Her tonnage is 7,269, and she is fitted with compound
engines of 9,500 I.H.P., and attaining a speed of 17½
knots per hour. She was taken up by the Government as a
transport in October, 1899, and so valuable did she prove for
this service that she was retained until the early part of 1903.
In 1884 the Directors purchased the celebrated iron steamship
<span class="smcap">Oregon</span>, built by Messrs. John Elder &amp; Co. She was 501 feet
by 54<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet by 38 feet, and of 7,375 tons and 13,500 I.H.P.;
speed 18 knots per hour. On her first and second voyage she
did not distinguish herself, but on her third voyage she made
the passage from Queenstown to New York in 6 days 10 hours
9 minutes, thereby excelling all previous records, and earning
for herself the title of “The Greyhound of the Atlantic.”
Towards the close of 1884 the <span class="smcap">Umbria</span>—the first of two steel
steamships ordered from Messrs. Elder—was delivered, and she
was followed early in 1885 by her sister ship the <span class="smcap">Etruria</span>. The
following description of the <span class="smcap">Etruria</span> applies also to the
<span class="smcap">Umbria</span>: Length 501<span class="xs"><sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet by 57<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet by 38<span class="xs"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span> feet;
gross tonnage 7,718 tons. The promenade deck, which extends
over the full breadth of the ship for nearly 300 feet amidships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
is reserved for the sole use of the first-class passengers. The
vessel easily accommodates 550 first-class passengers and 800
third-class. The state rooms are replete with all the fittings
usual in first-class vessels of the most modern type, and a
number of them are arranged en suite for family use. The hull
is divided into ten watertight compartments, and most of the
bulkheads are carried to the upper deck, while they are fitted
with waterproof and fireproof doors, which afford access to all
parts of the ship. The engines indicate 14,500 H.P., and are
compound, having three inverted cylinders—one high-pressure
71 in. in diameter and two low-pressure, each 105 in. in diameter.
The average speed of both steamers may be set down at 18½
knots per hour. The fastest passage of the <span class="smcap">Etruria</span> was when
she established a new record by making the passage from
Queenstown to New York in 5 days 20 hours 55 minutes, the
<span class="smcap">Umbria</span>’s best record being 5 days 22 hours 7 minutes. The
next important addition to the fleet was the <span class="smcap">Campania</span>, launched
from the yard of the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co., Govan, on the
8th September, 1892. Five months later—February, 1893—there
was launched from the same yard her sister ship the
<span class="smcap">Lucania</span>. From the official description of the <span class="smcap">Campania</span>, it
appears that her length over all is 620 feet, extreme breadth
65 feet 3 inches, depth from upper deck 43 feet, gross tonnage
12,950 tons. The bulkheads are sixteen in number, and they
will enable the vessel to float with any two, or in some cases
three, of the compartments open to the sea. Although fitted
with twin screws, there is an aperture in the stern frame similar
to that in a single screw steamer. This is provided that the
propellers may work freely, though they are fitted close to the
centre line of the ship, in order to prevent damage to or from
the quay walls. In the accommodation for passengers all the
latest improvements are to be found, and everything calculated
to render ocean travelling more comfortable and enjoyable
is introduced. The grand saloon, drawing room, library and
smoking rooms are noble in their proportions, and suggest the
stately chambers of a palace rather than accommodation within
the steel walls of a ship. It is worthy of special notice that
comfort has been studied in every detail, and perhaps nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>exemplifies this more than the fact that in all the principal
rooms there are coal fire-grates, the first that have ever been
used on board ship. There are four sets of generating plant,
capable of supplying throughout the ship 1,350 16-candle power
incandescent electric light, and in addition a powerful searchlight,
for facilitating the navigation into port, &amp;c. Wire to the
length of 40 miles runs through the ship. The grand saloon is
a magnificent hall in the modified Italian style, 100 feet long
by 63 feet broad, with seats at table for 430 passengers. In the
centre, a great crystal dome rises through the two decks above
to a height of 33 feet.</p><br>

<p>Three classes of passengers are carried by the <span class="smcap">Campania</span>, viz.,
first, second and third class; and roughly speaking there is
accommodation for about 1,400 passengers and 400 crew.
While the hulls of both vessels are almost unrivalled in size
and in the accommodation they afford, the machinery by which
they are propelled is almost unique in magnitude and skill in
construction. The two sets of triple-expansion engines in each
ship develop the enormous amount of 30,000 I.H.P. The
funnels of the <span class="smcap">Campania</span> and <span class="smcap">Lucania</span> from their lowest section
are 120 feet high, or about the height of the Eddystone Lighthouse,
and their diameter 20 feet.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Campania</span> has maintained an average speed for twelve
months, on her eastward runs, of 21·88 knots per hour, while
the <span class="smcap">Lucania</span> for the same period shows an average speed of
22·01 knots. The Mediterranean service has within the last
few years been greatly improved by the addition of four new
steel steamships, each of about 3,000 tons burthen. These are
the <span class="smcap">Pavia</span> (1897), <span class="smcap">Tyria</span> (1897), <span class="smcap">Cypria</span> (1898) and <span class="smcap">Veria</span>
(1899). The Boston service also comprises the following
modern steel twin-screw steamships:—<span class="smcap">Ivernia</span> and <span class="smcap">Saxonia</span>,
built in 1900, the <span class="smcap">Ultonia</span> in 1898, and the <span class="smcap">Sylvania</span> in 1895.
The <span class="smcap">Ivernia</span> and <span class="smcap">Saxonia</span> are practically alike, and call for
some special notice. They are the largest ships carrying
passengers and cargo to Boston. The principal dimensions of
the ships are—Length 600 feet, beam 64 feet 3 inches and depth
41 feet 6 inches. The gross tonnage is 14,027 tons, measurement
capacity 20,000 tons, while the displacement is no less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>than 25,000 tons. In their ordinary work across the Atlantic
they carry 200 first, 220 second, and about 1,900 third-class
passengers. If engaged in trooping, each ship could carry 200
officers and 3,500 men, together with 10,000 tons of stores.
The features of the ships, next to their huge size, are the
spaciousness and comfort of their passenger accommodation and
their steadiness, which is most remarkable, and which makes
sea sickness almost impossible. Aerial telegraphy is in regular
operation on board these two vessels. The Cunard was the first
steamship company to systematically adopt this latest development
of electrical science. It was in the <span class="smcap">Lucania</span> that Mr.
Marconi’s system was first set up, and so pleased were the
Directors with the results that they at once decided to adopt the
invention in their other steamers, the <span class="smcap">Campania</span>, <span class="smcap">Lucania</span>,
<span class="smcap">Etruria</span>, <span class="smcap">Umbria</span>, <span class="smcap">Carpathia</span>, <span class="smcap">Aurania</span>, <span class="smcap">Ivernia</span> and
<span class="smcap">Saxonia</span> all being now thus equipped.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent">R.M.S. <span class="smcap">Lucania</span>. Cunard Steamship Co.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In October, 1903, the <span class="smcap">Lucania</span> was the medium selected by
the inventor for further experiments in wireless telegraphy,
and on the voyage from New York to Liverpool completed on
October 10th, Signor Marconi successfully accomplished a
wonderful feat, and a newspaper with real news fresh from
the Marconi stations at Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and Poldhu,
Cornwall, was published every day. Messages were transmitted
over a distance of 2,000 miles as accurately as over the
same number of feet or yards, so that passengers on board the
<span class="smcap">Lucania</span> had their printed newspaper, the “Cunard Bulletin,”
every day of the voyage, containing the most interesting events
on both continents. Just before arrival in Liverpool a larger
edition of the “Cunard Bulletin,” a weekly issue, was printed
giving an epitome of the news recorded in the six daily
publications during the voyage, and marking a fresh era in
oceanic journalism.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Carpathia</span>, the latest addition to the Cunard fleet,
represents a new departure in Atlantic trade, being designed
exclusively for second and third-class passengers, all of whom
are accommodated in rooms containing two and four berths.
The dimensions of the <span class="smcap">Carpathia</span> are—Length 560 feet,
breadth 64 feet 3 inches, depth 40 feet 6 inches, and the gross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
tonnage is 13,555 tons. She started on her maiden voyage
May 5th, 1903, and being built on similar lines to the <span class="smcap">Ivernia</span>
and <span class="smcap">Saxonia</span> shares their reputation for remarkable steadiness
at sea even in the stormiest weather.</p>

<p>A recent item of interest in connection with this famous
company is the agreement made in August, 1903, with the
British Government, by which the Cunard Company are to
build two new steamers of an average speed of not less than
24½ knots, which, along with all other Cunard ships, are to
be at the disposal of the Admiralty for hire or purchase whenever
they may be required. To help them in this undertaking,
such fast ships being unprofitable for commercial purposes, the
Government lend the Company £2,600,000 to build the ships,
and grant them a subsidy of £150,000 a year.</p>

<p>In October, 1903, the Cunard Company started a new Winter
Passenger Service from New York to the Mediterranean ports,
calling at Gibraltar, Algiers, Naples, Palermo, Venice, Trieste
and Fiume. The <span class="smcap">Aurania</span> and <span class="smcap">Carpathia</span>, carrying only two
classes of passengers, were chosen for this new service, which
opens up a round of most interesting travel to the great
travelling public of moderate means. Passengers by these
steamers may land at any of the ports named and visit at
leisure places of interest in Spain, France, Italy, Germany,
Sicily, Austria or Hungary, continuing their journey overland
to England to return to New York by Cunard steamer from
Liverpool; or, if they prefer to do so, they may remain in the
ship all the time and return in her to New York; or, as a third
course, they may make a stay in any of the countries named
and rejoin a subsequent Cunard Mediterranean ship at any of
her calling ports.</p>

HOUSTON LINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This well-known line of steamers was established about a
quarter of a century ago by the present senior partner of the
firm, Mr. R. P. Houston, Member of Parliament for the
Toxteth Division of Liverpool. Like many other undertakings
which have grown to gigantic dimensions from small
beginnings, this firm started in a modest manner with one
small steamer. This was the steamer <span class="smcap">Athlete</span>, followed
in the year 1881 by a larger steamer, the <span class="smcap">Hercules</span>, built
by the Whitehaven Ship Building Co., and engined by Messrs.
J. Jones &amp; Sons, of Liverpool. She was a vessel of 742 tons
net register, and 1,155 tons gross register, her principal
dimensions being, length 212 feet, beam 34 feet and depth
16 feet 6 inches. Her engines, which were of 150 nominal
horse-power, were compound. These two vessels were not
engaged in any regular trade, but ran wherever profitable
freights could be obtained, and chiefly to Java and Eastern
ports. Becoming too small for Messrs. Houston’s requirements,
they were sold. All the succeeding vessels of the fleet,
of which there have been a great many, have been named after
Greek mythological deities or Roman celebrities, each name
beginning with the letter “H.”</p>

<p>Although already very busily engaged with large contracts
for the conveyance of material to the Panama Canal Co., and
the West African Co., Mr. Houston, believing there was ample
room for a new line of steamers to the River Plate from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>Liverpool, decided to enter upon that trade in the year 1884.
New steamers were designed and built specially for this trade,
and so energetically and successfully was the trade worked
that, although severe opposition was encountered at first from
the existing lines, in a short time not only were Messrs.
Houston’s steamers fully occupied, but many steamers had to
be chartered to meet the rapidly increasing traffic, since which
time the Houston Line has assumed very large proportions.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2380_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p2380_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Hydaspes s.s.</span> Houston Line.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first steamer engaged in this trade was the <span class="smcap">Hermes</span>,
built on the Clyde in 1882, and engined by Messrs. J. Jones
and Son, Liverpool. She was a much larger vessel than the
<span class="smcap">Hercules</span>, her gross register being 2,175 tons, and her
principal dimensions 290 feet in length by 40 feet beam and
22 feet depth.</p>

<p>After a short interval more steamers, each of about 2,000
tons gross, were added to the fleet in 1884. These were the
<span class="smcap">Hellenes</span>, built by Richardson, Duck &amp; Co., and engined
by G. Clark, of Sunderland—length 270 feet, beam 40 feet,
and depth 18 feet 7 inches; and the <span class="smcap">Hesperides</span>, built by
R. &amp; J. Evans &amp; Co., and engined by George Forrester &amp; Co.,
Liverpool—length 286 feet, beam 38 feet, and depth 24 feet.
The following year (1885) a larger boat than any yet built for
the firm was added to the fleet. This was the <span class="smcap">Heliades</span>,
built by Richardson, Duck &amp; Co., Stockton. She was 320 feet
long, and of proportionate beam and depth. Her gross
register was about 3,000 tons, and she was fitted with triple-expansion
engines by T. Richardson &amp; Co., of West Hartlepool,
with which class of engines all the succeeding steamers have
been fitted. A sister ship, but having more powerful engines, the
<span class="smcap">Heraclides</span> was launched for the firm in July, 1886. She
was followed in 1889 by the <span class="smcap">Hippomenes</span>, built at Belfast
by Workman, Clark &amp; Co., and the <span class="smcap">Hydarnes</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Hellopes</span>, built at Port Glasgow by J. Reid &amp; Co. These
steamers, like their immediate predecessors, were each of about
3,000 tons gross register, and were all practically of the same
dimensions. The whole of these four steamers are fitted with
refrigerators for the carriage of frozen meat from the River
Plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Alfred S. Collard, a gentleman with a large and varied
experience in the River Plate trade, and one thoroughly conversant
with the working and requirements of an important
steamship line, joined Mr. Houston as partner in 1893.</p>

<p>During the closing years of the last and beginning of the
present century the quantity of railway rolling stock and plant
for shipment to the River Plate was so great that it was not
an uncommon event for the Brunswick Station of the Cheshire
Lines Railway to be almost entirely blocked with wagons of
railway material consigned for shipment by the Houston Line.
So large were some of these packages, they could only be
brought through from the manufacturers on Sunday, it being
impossible to convey them on the railway while the ordinary
traffic was being carried on. In 1898 Messrs. Russell &amp; Co.,
of Port Glasgow, built two sister ships of over 3,500 tons gross
register for Messrs. Houston. These were the <span class="smcap">Herminius</span> and
the <span class="smcap">Horatius</span>.</p>

<p>The year 1899 was an important one in the firm’s history.
In that year the trade between New York and the River Plate
was entered, and since that time a regular service has been
maintained, the pioneer steamer being the <span class="smcap">Hermes</span> (the
second of that name). She was a steel built steamer of 3,400
tons gross, driven by triple expansion engines of about 2,500
horse-power effective. She was launched at Sunderland in
January, 1899, and is of the following dimensions:—Length
350 feet 2 inches, beam 47 feet, depth 17 feet. She was the
first of a fleet of seven similar vessels which were launched to
the order of the firm during the course of that year, the others
being the <span class="smcap">Honorius</span>, <span class="smcap">Hortensius</span>, <span class="smcap">Hyades</span>, <span class="smcap">Hydaspes</span>, <span class="smcap">Hylas</span>,
and the <span class="smcap">Hyanthes</span>.</p>

<p>The following year, the last of the 19th century, saw one
more steamer, the <span class="smcap">Hostilius</span>, added to the Line.</p>

<p>Frequent as were the additions to the Houston Fleet, they
were not sufficient to keep pace with the expanding trade,
which increased so rapidly that many outside steamers had
to be chartered. When ex-President Kruger sent his fateful
ultimatum to the British Government, which resulted in the
South African War, Messrs. Houston &amp; Co. were amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
first to offer their steamers to the Admiralty for the conveyance
of troops, horses, mules, fodder, &amp;c. It was of the
greatest importance that ships should be fitted up for the
transit of troops and animals for transport purposes as quickly
as possible, and this was carried out by the Houston Line
with eminent satisfaction to H.M. Government. The
principals and the staff worked night and day, and spared
no efforts in despatching quickly the men, horses and stores
so urgently required at the seat of war. Large numbers of
horses, mules and stores were carried by the Houston steamers
from the United Kingdom, the Continent and the United
States to the various South African ports with a gratifying
immunity from loss.</p>

<p>It may be stated here that the senior partner of the firm is
an expert engineer, and that all the steamers built for his
firm, and which have been so remarkably successful, have been
built from specifications and designs drawn up by him.</p>

<p>As has been stated, many of the steamers are fitted with
refrigerating machinery for the conveyance of frozen meat,
and are regularly employed in this trade. These steamers
are favourably known for the excellent condition in which
they deliver their cargoes, and in order that the live stock
should be landed in the very best possible condition, the
steamers were fitted up with permanent cattle fittings, and
made in every way suitable for successfully carrying live stock.</p>

<p>The Houston Line River Plate steamers take cargo from
Glasgow, Liverpool and New York for Monte Video, Buenos
Ayres, Rosario, &amp;c., without transhipment, which is a very
important matter in the opinion of shippers.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that a very serious fight
is being waged (1903) in the South African shipping trade,
owing to the entrance therein of the Houston Line. In July,
1902, sailings from Glasgow, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Liverpool
and London (as well as from New York) to Cape Town,
Algoa Bay, East London, Durban and Delagoa Bay were
announced by the Messrs. Houston. The Steamship Lines
then engaged in the trade had formed a Conference or “ring.”
The members of this “ring” are the Union-Castle Line, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Clan Line, the Bucknall Line, the Harrison-Ellerman Line,
J. T. Rennie &amp; Co., and Bullard, King &amp; Co., forming the
strongest shipping ring ever known. It is this shipping
“ring” that the Houston Line is opposing.</p>

<p>Great public interest in the struggle has been excited by
the many angry and strongly worded letters from shippers
which have been published from time to time in the current
Press regarding the <em>modus operandi</em> of the “ring.” Tactics
of such a character have been adopted by the “ring” as will,
we understand, form a subject of an action in the Courts of
Law, as they have already provoked discussion and protest in
various Chambers of Commerce, and have even been discussed
in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>From present appearances the Houston Line is growing
steadily in favour of shippers to the Cape ports, and having
now been in the trade for over twelve months it must have
secured a firm foothold. Certainly shippers and merchants
generally welcome and support this “Line” as having a
beneficial influence upon the trade between this country and
our South African Colonies.</p>

<p>The latest built and largest steamers of the fleet are
engaged in the Cape service. Amongst them are
<span class="smcap">Hyacinthus</span>, <span class="smcap">Halizones</span>, <span class="smcap">Hydaspes</span> and <span class="smcap">Hypatia</span>, with an
average dead weight carrying capacity of about 9,000 tons
each.</p>

<p>We understand several large carrying steamers are in course
of construction for the firm.</p>

<p>As showing the great increase in the size of the firm’s
vessels, it may be interesting to compare the dimensions of
one of the earliest and of one of the latest built ships.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hercules</span> was 212 feet long, 34 feet broad and 16 feet
6 inches deep.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hypatia</span> is 452 feet long, 52 feet 2 inches broad, and
28 feet 3 inches deep.</p>

<p>The gross registered tonnage of the former was 1,155 tons,
while that of the latter is over 5,600 tons.</p>

<p>The growth of the Houston Line has been a remarkably
rapid one, and shows what ability and energy combined can do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>The fleet now consists of 25 steamers of a gross registered
tonnage of over 90,000 tons, and with a dead weight carrying
capacity of over 130,000 tons.</p><br>

HOULDER LINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Company was founded by the late Mr. Edwin Savory
Houlder in London in 1849, and he was subsequently joined
by his brothers Messrs. Alfred and Augustus Houlder. At
first the business was confined to sailing-ships, a fleet of
Clipper Packets sailing under the firm’s flag between the home
ports and Australia being established. As the business
increased, the firm became in turn interested in the South
African and South American Trades, the development of their
steam fleet receiving a large amount of attention, until, at the
present time, it includes some of the largest and most successful
frozen meat carriers afloat.</p>

<p>The principal services now maintained are between the
United Kingdom and South America, between South America
and the Cape ports, between Australia and New Zealand and
the Cape ports, and from New York to Australia and New
Zealand, although many other trades of the world claim the
Company’s attention and for these trades a large amount of
tonnage is chartered annually.</p>

<p>The Headquarters are in London, with Branches at Liverpool,
Glasgow, Sydney, N.S.W., Cape Town and Buenos Aires; also
sub-offices at Rosario and La Plata.</p>

<p>With one exception, the steamers of the Fleet are distinguished
by the affix <span class="smcap">Grange</span>. The first were the <span class="smcap">Hornby
Grange</span> (3,750 tons burthen) and <span class="smcap">Ovingdean Grange</span> (3,520
tons burthen), launched in the opening months of 1890, both
vessels being insulated throughout for carrying frozen meat,
as are all the other steamers of the Line. They were followed
in 1894 by the <span class="smcap">Urmston Grange</span>, designed to carry 5,420 tons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>In 1896 two important additions were made in the shape of
the steamers <span class="smcap">Langton Grange</span> and <span class="smcap">Denton Grange</span>, each
having a deadweight capacity of 9,200 tons, and like the earlier
steamers insulated in the most efficient manner for carrying
frozen meat. In the meantime two more steamers were
acquired, the <span class="smcap">Elstree Grange</span> and the <span class="smcap">Southern Cross</span>, the
latter being placed in the Australian trade in company with
the <span class="smcap">Langton Grange</span> and <span class="smcap">Denton Grange</span>, whilst the former
was taken into the River Plate service which had grown to
such an extent as to justify the addition of two further vessels,
larger and faster than any of the earlier ships in the trade.
These were the <span class="smcap">Royston Grange</span> and <span class="smcap">Beacon Grange</span>, each
6,400 tons burthen, and capable of making the passage between
England and the River Plate in twenty-two or twenty-three
days.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2460_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Beacon Grange</span>. Houlder Bros. &amp; Co.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the Australian trade the <span class="smcap">Rippingham Grange</span>, a sister
ship to the <span class="smcap">Langton Grange</span>, was added in 1898.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the various steamers comprising the fleet
were amalgamated into one Company under the name of the
Houlder Line, Limited, this step being taken in order to consolidate
the business generally, and to ensure more systematic
and economical working.</p>

<p>Previous to this, however, the firm of Houlder Bros. &amp; Co.
was converted into a Limited Company, the partners in the old
firm becoming Managing Directors of the new Company, Mr.
Edwin Savory Houlder acting as Chairman until his death in
1901.</p>

<p>To return to our description of the fleet. To replace the
<span class="smcap">Denton Grange</span> (unfortunately lost at Las Palmas) the Company
contracted for the <span class="smcap">Drayton Grange</span>, a fine four-masted,
twin-screw steamer of 10,000 tons burthen, launched in
December, 1901, and also for a sister ship, the <span class="smcap">Oswestry
Grange</span>, launched a few months later. Both of these steamers,
and, in fact, the other large vessels of the fleet, did excellent
service during the South African War.</p><br>

LAIRD LINE.<br>

THE GLASGOW, DUBLIN, AND LONDONDERRY<br>
STEAM PACKET CO., LTD.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This important company, which claims (on very strong
evidence) to be the oldest steamship company in the world,
was originated in 1814—two years after the launch of Bell’s
<span class="smcap">Comet</span>—by Mr. Lewis MacLellan and others. Its history is
a most varied one, the several firms of Alex. A. Laird &amp; Sons,
Thos. Cameron &amp; Co., and MacConnell &amp; Laird, having become
unified during its existence of nearly a century into the one
large concern known throughout the kingdom as the “Laird
Line.”</p>

<p>It has been the great pioneer of the steamship trade of the
Clyde, not merely by reason of its long standing, but also
because of the varied and extensive sphere of its operations.</p>

<p>The first steamer owned by the founder of the company was
the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, a small paddle-wheel steampacket, built, like
all the vessels of her time, of wood.</p>

<p>The second steampacket was the <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, built in 1816.
A reference is made to both these steamers in the sixth chapter
of the first part of this volume. They plied between the
Bromielaw (Glasgow) and Greenock, Gourock, Rothesay,
Tarbert, Lochgilphead, and Inverary. Even in these early
days of steam navigation, it was the avowed policy of the
manager of these steampackets to make all things subordinate
to safety, and, in accordance with this policy, the masters of
the steamers were instructed “not to contend with other boats
so as to endanger the vessels, or alarm the passengers,” This
sound policy, which has been continued by Mr. MacLellan’s
successors to the present day, has, in large measure, contributed
to the popularity and success of the firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that over eighty years ago passenger
season tickets were in force on the steampackets of this
company. Those who are desirous of verifying this statement
can do so by referring to the “Glasgow Chronicle” of
the 23rd May, 1816, in which they will find the following
advertisement:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The steampackets, <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> and <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, sail
regularly from the Bromielaw to all the watering-places
on both sides of the Clyde. Families wishing to agree
for the season will learn the terms by applying to the
masters on board, or to Mr. Lewis MacLellan,
Gallowgate.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, in the year referred to, opened up for the
first time, steam communication between Glasgow and
Campbeltown, and in the early summer of 1820, she made her
first trip from Glasgow to the Giant’s Causeway.</p>

<p>She was commanded on that voyage by Captain Wyse, whose
death in 1851 was the occasion of the following paragraph,
which appeared in the “Glasgow Chronicle”:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Captain Wyse (whose decease we announce) was the
first to carry his steamer, the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, on a pleasure
trip from the Clyde to the Giant’s Causeway, with an
illustrious and distinguished party. The astonished
inhabitants in thousands crowded the hills and promontories,
all along the shores of Antrim, to see a ship with
a smoking funnel, and a band of music on board, sailing
against wind and tide. Out of this pleasure trip sprung
up the present lucrative trade between the ports of the
Clyde and the North of Ireland, from which great advantages
have unquestionably arisen to the inhabitants of
both kingdoms.”</p>
</div>

<p>As time advanced, the river traffic was discontinued by the
Company, and the cross-channel trade developed. After
running excursions to the Giant’s Causeway for two seasons, the
<span class="smcap">Britannia</span> was placed on the Glasgow and Londonderry station,
sailing from each port once a week.</p>

<p>Mr. Alex. A. Laird (after whom the line is named) was a
well-known shipbroker in Greenock at the beginning of the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
century, and when the famous St. George Steam Packet Company
commenced operations in 1822, the first steamship service
it established was between Liverpool and Greenock, and Mr.
Laird was appointed agent for the Company at the latter port.</p>

<p>The St. George Company did not continue for any length of
time its direct service between the Clyde and the Mersey, but
in the following year (1823) a new steam packet company was
formed, to trade only between Liverpool, Greenock and
Glasgow, calling at Douglas (Isle of Man) and Portpatrick.
Mr. Laird was the manager of the new company, and opened a
branch office at 25, York Street, Glasgow, under the style of
Alex. Laird &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The pioneer steamer of the new service was the <span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span>,
built by Mr. Thomas Wilson, a celebrated Liverpool shipbuilder,
in 1823. She was considered a very smart craft in
those days, was fitted with two engines of 30 horse power each,
and carried about 120 tons all told, on a draft of about 8 feet.
She continued on the Glasgow and Liverpool station until
1831, when she was purchased by Messrs. James Little &amp; Co.,
for their Glasgow and Newry trade.</p>

<p>The original intention of the proprietors was that the
<span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span> should sail to and from Glasgow, but it was
found there was not sufficient water in the Clyde to enable
this to be done with regularity, and Greenock was, consequently,
made the port of arrival and departure. The deck
fare by this steamer was 6s. per passenger, the steerage fare
by the mail packets (<span class="smcap">Majestic</span> and <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span>) being
21s.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Alex. A. Laird commenced his apprenticeship
under his father in 1824, and the same year a second vessel,
the <span class="smcap">James Watt</span>, was placed on the Glasgow and Liverpool
station. She was slightly larger, and had engines of greater
power than the <span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span>.</p>

<p>The following year Messrs. Laird established a fortnightly
service between Glasgow and Inverness; the steampacket
employed was the <span class="smcap">Stirling</span>, which made her first voyage on
the 11th May, 1825, and continued to sail thereafter on alternate
Wednesdays from Glasgow and Inverness. Fortnightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
sailings proving insufficient for the traffic, the sailings were
increased to weekly on and from the 20th September, 1826.</p>

<p>During this year the <span class="smcap">William Huskisson</span> was added to the
Liverpool and Glasgow service, and sailings were maintained
three times per week from each port.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">William Huskisson</span> was a very much larger vessel
than either of her predecessors, her deadweight capacity being
350 tons, and her engines 120 horse power.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="p2540_ill" style="max-width: 49.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p2540_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">The late Mr. <span class="smcap">Alex. A. Laird</span>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the Campbeltown and Londonderry trade the steampackets
<span class="smcap">Clydesdale</span> and <span class="smcap">Londonderry</span> were built, and were
advertised to sail from Glasgow to both ports, with goods and
passengers, every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. In
addition to these sailings, the <span class="smcap">Maid of Islay</span> was despatched
every Tuesday morning from the Bromielaw to Stranraer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Islay. Messrs. Laird’s connection with Dublin dates also from
this year, the pioneer steamer being the <span class="smcap">Town of Drogheda</span>,
which sailed on her first voyage from Greenock to Dublin on
Monday, 7th June, 1826. The new steampacket <span class="smcap">Solway</span> was
added to the Liverpool and Greenock fleet in 1828, and the
sailings increased to four per week from each port. The
steampacket <span class="smcap">Clarence</span> acted as tender, and sailed from the
Bromielaw at noon on the sailing dates of the Liverpool steampackets
from Greenock.</p>

<p>In 1834 the firm extended its operations to Newry, the
steamers employed being the <span class="smcap">Erin</span> and <span class="smcap">St. David</span>. Mr. James
Bruce was admitted a partner in the Glasgow house this year,
and the office was removed to 69, Oswald Street, where the
business was conducted under the style of Laird &amp; Bruce.
This partnership was dissolved on the 14th February, 1835;
Mr. Bruce retaining the Stranraer trade. The title of Mr.
Laird’s firm was changed to Alex. Laird &amp; Sons, and the
Glasgow office removed to Ewing Place, corner of York Street.</p>

<p>One of the steamers, for which Mr. Laird was agent, was
named the <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>. This vessel took an active part in
the Spanish Expedition of 1835, as a transport, making three
voyages to Spain during this year, with recruits from the West
of Scotland for the service of Donna Isabella. Some of these
recruits enlisted in the course of drunken frolics, or after
quarrels with their friends or masters, and their military
ardour speedily cooled. The period during which they had to
wait on the receiving ship at Greenock until the transport
was ready to receive them afforded frequent opportunities of
deserting, of which they did not fail to avail themselves.
Scarcely a day passed but some of them succeeded in escaping
by means of the boats which visited the receiving ships in the
evenings. One youth from Glasgow, failing to get away in
this manner, determined to drop into the sea and swim ashore,
a distance of about two miles, to a spit where female friends
would be waiting to assist him. He had nearly reached the
shore when he was discovered, and pursued by the guard boat.
Making a final effort, he succeeded in landing, and, though
fatigued with his long swim, continued his flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>When the guard boat’s crew landed, the women got round
them, and so hampered them in their movements that the
fugitive got out of sight, when, of course, it was useless to
attempt to follow him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>, after performing the three voyages
referred to, returned to her station between Glasgow and
Dublin.</p>

<p>In 1844 Messrs. Laird &amp; Sons (then at 101, Union Street)
were appointed agents at Glasgow for the Dundalk Steam
Packet Co., the first steamer from Glasgow, the <span class="smcap">Finn Maccoul</span>,
sailing on the 30th November, 1844.</p>

<p>For a period of forty years, from 1827 to 1867, Messrs. T.
Cameron &amp; Co. had maintained steamship services between
Glasgow and Greenock, and ports on the North and West coasts
of Ireland, and from 1843 until 1867 a weekly service between
Liverpool and Sligo. In 1867 the Glasgow services were conducted
by the joint firms of Messrs. T. Cameron &amp; Co. and Alex.
A. Laird &amp; Co., but the following year, owing to the decease of
Mr. Cameron, the business was entirely taken over by Messrs.
Laird.</p>

<p>Messrs. Cameron’s steamers were named after flowers and
plants (with two exceptions, referred to later), the first steamer
of this class being the <span class="smcap">Shamrock</span>, built in 1847, followed by the
<span class="smcap">Thistle</span> in 1848, <span class="smcap">Rose</span> in 1851, <span class="smcap">Myrtle</span> in 1854, and the
<span class="smcap">Garland</span> in 1857.</p>

<p>At the time of the change of firm, Messrs. Cameron &amp; Co. had
been opposed on the Glasgow and Sligo and Liverpool and Sligo
stations, for ten years, by a local company, the Sligo Steam
Navigation Co. This was subsequently settled amicably,
Messrs. Alex. A. Laird &amp; Co. retired from the Liverpool and
Sligo trade, and the Sligo Steam Navigation Co. withdrew from
the Glasgow trade, and having purchased the opposition steamer
<span class="smcap">Garland</span>, renamed her the <span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>.</p>

<p>The two exceptions in class of name, to which reference has
been made, were the <span class="smcap">Northman</span> and <span class="smcap">Irishman</span>, trading as the
Glasgow and Dublin Screw Steam Packet Co. They were
amongst the earliest iron screw steamers built, the former
having been launched in 1847 and the latter in 1854. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
two steamers retained the colour of the old St. George Co. on
the funnel, viz., a white funnel with a black top. The <span class="smcap">Irishman</span>
was the last steamer so distinguished, all succeeding
steamers carrying what is now the recognised “Laird” funnel—white
and red in equal proportions, with a black top.</p>

<p>In 1869, to meet the requirements of the West Coast of
Ireland trade, the Company purchased the steamer <span class="smcap">Scotia</span>, and
renamed her the <span class="smcap">Laurel</span>. Two steamers were added to the
fleet in 1878. These were the steamships <span class="smcap">Azalea</span> and <span class="smcap">Cedar</span>.
These ships are identical in measurement and capacity, each
being 217 feet long, 30 feet broad, and 15 feet deep, with a
gross register of 750 tons, and with excellent saloon accommodation
for seventy passengers.</p>

<p>An important addition was made to the fleet in 1879, when
the magnificent and fast steamship <span class="smcap">Shamrock</span> was built. She
was considerably in advance in point of capacity, speed, and
accommodation of any steamer previously built for the firm.
She measures 231 feet 2 inches in length, 31 feet 3 inches in
breadth, and 15 feet 5 inches in depth; and her gross register
is 864 tons. She is certified to carry eighty saloon passengers,
and is equipped with every modern convenience for their comfort.</p>

<p>After an interval of three years (1882) the <span class="smcap">Brier</span> was built,
a somewhat similar vessel, but slightly smaller than the preceding
steamer, her dimensions being 209 feet by 30 feet by
15 feet. Her gross register is 728 tons, and she has berthing
and saloon accommodation for sixty passengers. She was
quickly followed by the <span class="smcap">Thistle</span> and <span class="smcap">Elm</span>, both built in 1884,
and the <span class="smcap">Gardenia</span> in 1885. They are all beautiful specimens of
marine architecture, the first a large steamer of 822 tons gross
register, and the latter considerably smaller.</p>

<p>In 1893 a further advance was made in the size of the Company’s
ships by the construction of the splendid screw steamer
<span class="smcap">Olive</span>, 1,141 tons gross register, one of the fastest and finest
steamers crossing the channel. She is 260 feet long, with a
beam of 33 feet 1 inch, and a depth of 15 feet 8 inches. She
has always been a particular favourite with passengers, of whom
she carries a large number, being certified to carry one hundred
saloon passengers, in addition to 1,000 steerage.</p><br>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Daisy</span> and the <span class="smcap">Lily</span> were the next steamers built, the
former in 1895, and the latter in 1896; and in the closing year
of the nineteenth century the <span class="smcap">Fern</span> (second of the name) was
launched.</p>

<p>The latest addition to the fleet is a magnificent vessel constructed
after the most modern type of passenger steamships.
She is named the <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, was launched in June, 1902, is built of
steel, and is 250 feet long, 36 feet 2 inches broad, and 15 feet
deep. She is fitted with electric light in the saloon, staterooms
and holds. Her saloon, which is a handsomely furnished and
spacious apartment, is situated amidships forward of the engine
room. The great breadth of the vessel makes her a remarkably
steady sea boat, while her engines, which are triple-expansion
and of great power, are capable of propelling her at the rate of
15½ knots per hour. She is nearly 1,400 tons gross, and
carries 140 saloon passengers, in addition to those in the
steerage.</p>

<p>In 1885 it was considered desirable to consolidate the several
interests concerned, by forming this old-established business
into a limited company, the title of the Company being The
Glasgow, Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Co., Limited;
but it is much better known by the short name of the “Laird
Line.” Mr. William MacConnell, son of the late Mr.
MacConnell, of the firm of Thomson &amp; MacConnell, is the
Managing Director.</p>

<p>The company’s steamship services are not confined to those
to and from Glasgow, although we have shown that they have
a very large share of the Clyde traffic, maintaining regular
and frequent sailings between Glasgow and Greenock and
Dublin, Londonderry, Coleraine, Sligo, Ballina and Westport;
also during the tourist season a daily daylight service between
Ardrossan and Portrush.</p>

<p>In connection with the Midland Railway Company of
England a service of powerful steamers is maintained between
Morecambe and Dublin, the steamers sailing from the respective
ports on alternate days, and making the passage in about
10 hours.</p>

<p>Early next year, it is proposed to transfer the service from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
Morecambe to Heysham, and to maintain daily sailings to and
from the latter port and Dublin.</p>

<p>The “Laird” steamers also sail in connection with the same
railway company from Morecambe to Londonderry every
Tuesday and Saturday, returning from Londonderry every
Monday and Thursday.</p>

<p>From Fleetwood, in connection with the Lancashire and
Yorkshire, and London and North-Western Railway Companies,
a weekly service had been maintained for many years
by the company’s steamers between Fleetwood and Londonderry,
but in September, 1903, Messrs. Laird &amp; Co. retired
from this service.</p>

<p>From Liverpool also, steam communication is maintained
with Larne, Coleraine and Westport. The fixed sailings are
once a week from each port, but extra steamers are
despatched according to the requirements of the trade.</p>

<p>The company’s fleet at the present date (1903) consists of 12
first-class powerful steamships, having an aggregate gross
tonnage of 9,164 tons, and named as follows:—</p>

LANGLANDS’ LINE.<br>

Glasgow and Liverpool Royal Steampacket Company.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Prior to the year 1839 all the steampackets plying between
Liverpool and Glasgow were built of wood, and these wooden
steamers had established for themselves a reputation for
speed and luxurious travelling not surpassed nearly three-quarters
of a century later. It was, therefore, a bold thing
to do on the part of the proprietors of the Glasgow and Liverpool
Royal Steampacket Company to enter into competition
with these famous and tried vessels, and to introduce into the
trade steamers constructed not of wood but of iron. The
pioneer steamer of this company, the <span class="smcap">Royal Sovereign</span>,
sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on Monday, 18th
March, 1839. The company despatched their steamer twice
a week from each port, and continued to do so until the end
of August of the same year, when the second steamer, the
<span class="smcap">Royal George</span>, was placed on the station, and the sailings
were increased to four times per week each way. The established
lines were naturally indisposed to share the trade with
an outsider, and to discourage the new enterprise they
reduced the rates of freight on fine goods to 1d. per foot, and
on steerage passengers to 1s. each. The Royal Steampacket
Company maintained, in spite of this endeavour to drive
them out of the trade, their advertised sailings, and grew in
popularity with the travelling public. They decided in 1841
to increase their fleet by the addition of a third steamer, and
it being evident that they had come to stay, their competitors,
Messrs. MacIver and Messrs. Burns, entered into a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>friendly and honourable alliance with them, and uniform
rates were adopted by the three lines to Glasgow.</p><br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Princess Maud</span>. M. Langlands &amp; Sons.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A tradition exists in the Royal Company that when their
third steamer was on the stocks the first birth in her late
Majesty’s family was anticipated, and the proprietors proposed
to call their new steamer the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>. The event,
however, proved the name to be inappropriate, and <span class="smcap">Princess
Royal</span> was substituted, a name which has been perpetuated
by different steamships to the present day. The following
paragraph respecting this steamer, which appeared in the
“Glasgow Chronicle” of the 1st June, 1842, will be read
with interest:—“The <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>. We feel much
indebted to the agent (Mr. M. Langlands) of this splendid
steamer for putting us in possession of the ‘Morning
Chronicle’ of yesterday morning three hours before the
arrival of the ‘London Mail’ containing the details of the
attempted assassination of Her Majesty. Copies of the
‘Chronicle,’ ‘Times,’ and other London journals were, the
moment the train arrived from Greenock, forwarded to the
different public reading rooms in town, and altogether the
public are much indebted to the proprietors and agents of
the vessel at Liverpool and Glasgow for their public spirit
and enterprise. The passage from Liverpool to Greenock
was made in the astonishing space of 16½ hours.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span> referred to was built by the eminent
firm of Tod and M’Gregor, who in 1849 projected a line of
steamers to run between Glasgow and New York. Accordingly
they built and equipped the barque-rigged screw
steamer <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span>, and appointed Mr. M. Langlands
agent. She was a vessel of 1,087 tons register, with engines
of 350 horse-power, and was manned by about 70 of a crew.
In the Art Palace at Kelvingrove, Glasgow, there is a watercolour
drawing (No. 2,018, by S. Bough) representing the
departure of this the first steamship for New York from
Glasgow harbour, in April, 1850. After making several very
successful voyages, Tod and M’Gregor sold her to Richardson
Bros., of Belfast, who ran her in the Liverpool and
Philadelphia trade, and this vessel and the steamship <span class="smcap">City of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span><span class="smcap">Manchester</span> were the nucleus of what became afterwards the
well-known Inman line.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2640_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent">Paddle Steampacket <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>. M. Langlands &amp; Sons.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In view of the high reputation the <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span> had
earned, it is not surprising that she was selected for experimental
purposes by a Committee of the House of Commons
(appointed in 1842) for the purpose of inquiring into the conveyance
of the mails between England and Ireland. From
the “Liverpool Mercury” of that date we learn that “The
fine new iron steamboat called <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>, at present
on the station between this port and Glasgow, started from
Clarence Dock on Sunday morning last (19th June) for
Dublin. She arrived there in 9 hours 5 minutes, beating
H.M. mail steampacket <span class="smcap">Medusa</span> by 1 hour 45 minutes. On
Monday morning she left Dublin for Holyhead, and arrived
there in 4 hours 45 minutes, returning to Dublin the same
day in 4 hours 28 minutes. In the evening she started for
Liverpool, which she reached in 9 hours 35 minutes. The
vessel had a head wind nearly all the way.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Princess</span> had now established beyond dispute her
claim to be one of the fastest Channel steamers leaving the
port. The ensuing winter she proved herself to be also one
of the best sea-boats. The terrible gale of January 20th to
22nd, 1843, was one of the most severe that ever visited these
coasts. The <span class="smcap">Mona’s Isle</span>, from Liverpool to Douglas, was 24
hours on the passage. At Cork the posts on the quays were
carried away. The <span class="smcap">Princess</span> was at sea during this storm,
and fully proved her excellent qualities as a sea-boat. She
left Greenock at 11-30 p.m. on Friday, and arrived at Liverpool
at 5 p.m. on Saturday without the slightest damage.
This celebrated steamer was replaced in 1856 by a second
<span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>, also a paddle steamer. After running in
the Liverpool and Glasgow service for about four years,
<span class="smcap">Princess</span> No. 2 was sold to the General Steam Navigation
Company, of London.</p>

<p>The third <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>, built in 1861, was a screw
steamer, the first screw owned by the Glasgow and Liverpool
Royal Steampacket Company. In 1861, civil war broke out
in the United States. The Federals (Northerners) established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
a strict blockade of all the Southern ports on the Atlantic
seaboard. A cotton famine ensued, and fast steamers were
in great demand for blockade running. Amongst other
Liverpool steamers purchased for this purpose was the new
<span class="smcap">Princess</span>. She was sold in 1862, and her new owners
changed her name. We are informed that she was captured
on her first trip as a Confederate blockade runner, and converted
by her captors into a Federal cruiser. Her immediate
successor, the fourth <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>, after running for a
number of years between Liverpool and Glasgow, was sold to
a firm to trade in the West Indies. For the present the
Royal Steampacket Company is without a <span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span>,
the fifth steamer of that name having been sold in 1901 to
foreign buyers. The service is meantime maintained by the
<span class="smcap">Princess Louise</span>, or other steamer of the fleet.</p>

<p>About the year 1870, the Royal Company opened up a new
steamship service from Liverpool to the West Highlands,
North of Scotland, and east coast ports. Owing, in large
measure, to the natural attractions of the route, and the
excellence of the accommodation and cuisine provided on the
steamers, this is every year becoming a more popular and
favourite trip. The first steamer employed on the West
Highland and east coast route was a small cargo steamer, but
in a very short time it was found necessary to place the
<span class="smcap">Princess Alice</span>, a much larger steamer, carrying passengers
as well as cargo, on the route. The earlier vessels on this
service were steamers of 300 to 400 tons, with limited accommodation
for about 20 passengers, but now the steamers
employed have accommodation for 100 to 140 saloon passengers,
and an average cargo-carrying capacity of nearly 1,000 tons each.
Some idea may be gained of the growth of the passenger and
cargo traffic, by comparing the earlier vessels with the new
<span class="smcap">Princess Maud</span>, built in 1901. This steamer is of steel, and
her dimensions are:—Length, 256 feet 6 inches; breadth,
36 feet 6 inches; depth, 17 feet 1½ inches. Gross tonnage,
1,450 tons. The vessel is handsomely fitted up for
passengers, the large dining saloon being furnished in solid
oak, artistically carved. One hundred first-class passengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
can dine at one sitting, and there is sleeping accommodation
in deck rooms and state cabins for 140 passengers. The
steamer is fitted throughout with electric light, patent berths,
sea-water baths, ample lavatories, and every modern convenience
that can contribute to the comfort of passengers.
The <span class="smcap">Princess Maud</span> was placed on the service early in 1902,
and will no doubt enhance the reputation in which this line
is held by tourists. In addition to the bi-weekly service
between Liverpool and Aberdeen, Leith, and Dundee, the
Royal Steampacket Company run a regular service of
steamers between Aberdeen, Newcastle, Hull, and other east
coast ports, and Bristol, Cardiff, and Swansea, calling also at
Southampton and Plymouth. During the summer months
this service embraces a fortnightly trip round the United
Kingdom with one of the larger passenger steamers, and this
has now become a favourite cruise for summer holiday
seekers, occupying as it does about twelve days.</p>

<p>When the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894, the
Royal Company began at once to despatch their steamers
from Manchester to Glasgow, as well as to the west, north,
and east coasts of Scotland. In addition to having the
management of the various services mentioned, Messrs.
Langlands have, for a great many years, been the agents of
Messrs. Alex. A. Laird and Co. as regards the steamers
trading between Liverpool, Larne, and Westport.</p>

<p>The agency of the company’s steamers at Glasgow, Liverpool,
Manchester, Leith, Dundee and Hull, is in the hands of
Messrs. M. Langlands and Sons, who have been closely identified
with the development of the company’s business, and are
largely interested in its success.</p><br>

Messrs. James Little &amp; Co.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Towards the end of July, 1819, Messrs. James Little &amp; Co.,
who had commenced business seven years previously, despatched
from Greenock, on her maiden voyage to Liverpool,
the first passenger steamer that ever sailed from the Clyde to
the Mersey. Her name was the <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>, and she
was described in her advertisements as being “an elegant new
Steam Packet, having most excellent accommodation for
passengers.” As a matter of fact, she was a small wooden
paddle steamer, 98 feet long, or about twelve feet longer than
the Cluthas that ply up and down Glasgow Harbour, but with
twice their beam. She called at Portpatrick and Douglas
(I. of M.) on her voyages to and from the Clyde, and occupied
about thirty hours on the run from Greenock to Liverpool.
The following letter from the Captain (Patterson) to Messrs.
Little, written on the 1st September, 1819, indicates how
different are the conditions under which passengers travel by
steamers at the present date and those which existed in the
early stages of steam navigation. Captain Patterson dated his
letter from Troon, and stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have to inform you that we were taken with a heavy
gale of wind from the N.W. yesterday about two o’clock, just
as we had got outside the Cumbraes, with a heavy sea; about
six o’clock the sea came more to the westward, and, from the
very heavy sea on our beam, we made so much lee-way that
we could not stand out-channel nor fetch Lamlash. I, therefore
thought it best to bear up for this port, and got in safe
last night with the loss of our bowsprit, but no other damage.
Our engines worked very well, only the wheels had little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
effect owing to the heavy sea. It has continued to blow a
gale all night, and still looks very bad. The ship <span class="smcap">Nereus</span>
got here an hour before us, dismasted. I will get another
bowsprit as soon as possible, and will proceed when it
moderates. The passengers were all sick, but are now well.</p>

<p class="right">
“I am, &amp;c.,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
“<span class="smcap">John Patterson</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>“P.S.—The <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span> behaved under her sails,
double reefed, as well as any ship I was ever in.”</p>
</div>

<p>The rates of passage money were:—Cabin, 40s.; steerage,
21s. A second steamer, the <span class="smcap">Superb</span>, was placed on the
station during the same season, and in 1820 a larger steamer,
the <span class="smcap">Majestic</span>, was added to the service.</p>

<p>An interesting and valuable painting of the latter steamer
in 1820 is in the possession of Messrs. Little &amp; Co., at their
office, 46, Leadenhall Street, London.</p>

<p>A curious intimation appears in the Glasgow papers of the
19th July, 1822, with reference to the same vessel. It appears
that on a recent trip the Duke of Athol and suite had
embarked on board the <span class="smcap">Majestic</span> at Greenock, for conveyance
to Douglas (I. of M.), where his Grace had a seat (Mona
Castle). As well as being accompanied by the members of his
suite, His Grace had with him several carriages and a quantity
of luggage, all of which took some time to land. Some of the
Liverpool passengers complained of the detention of the steampacket
for this purpose, and, on the complaint being submitted
to the managers of the steamer, they not only expressed their
regret for the delay, but they also donated the amount of
freight they received from the Duke of Athol to the fund for
the relief of the starving Irish.</p>

<p>A fourth steamer, the <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span>, was added to
the fleet on the 21st June, 1822. The <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>
having become too small for the Greenock and Liverpool
service was transferred to the Liverpool and Douglas station,
and the three larger steamers were appointed to carry H.M.
mails to and from Greenock and Liverpool. The wretched
condition of the destitute poor in Ireland was not the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
charity that appealed to the managers of these steamers.
Finding that the Committee of the Greenock Hospital and
Infirmary were in urgent need of funds, they placed the
R.M.S. <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span> at the Committee’s disposal for
one day, for the benefit of the Institution named. The Committee
of Management of the Hospital accordingly arranged a
cruise per that steamer around Ailsa Craig, on Saturday, 19th
July, 1823, tickets for which were 7s. 6d. each. The <span class="smcap">City
of Glasgow</span> continued to trade between Greenock and
Liverpool until 1831, when she was purchased by the late
David MacIver, who was then forming the City of Glasgow
Steam Packet Co. Although Messrs. Little’s connection with
Belfast is not of such long standing as with Liverpool, yet it
is approaching three-quarters of a century. In January,
1828, the new steamer <span class="smcap">Frolic</span> began to trade between
Glasgow, Greenock and Belfast. She differed from the
steamers of the Liverpool route in carrying cargo as well as
passengers. The previous year, Messrs. Little had obtained
the agency in Greenock of the Glasgow and Dublin Shipping
Company. The pioneer steamer of this line was the <span class="smcap">Erin</span>,
which sailed from the Clyde on her first voyage in March,
1827. A second steamer, the <span class="smcap">Scotia</span>, a vessel of 300 tons
burden, was added to the service in January, 1828. The
steamer <span class="smcap">Water Witch</span>, built for this trade by Messrs.
James Little &amp; Co., and contracted for with Messrs. Denny &amp;
Co., of Dumbarton, was the first screw steamer built on the
Clyde.</p>

<p>In addition to their several channel steamers, Messrs.
Little owned, in 1850, the steamers <span class="smcap">Dunoon</span> and <span class="smcap">Helensburgh</span>.
These two steamers plied with passengers between
Greenock and coast towns, connecting with the Glasgow and
Greenock Railway (now the Caledonian Railway), and they
were the first steamers on the Clyde to run in connection with
a Railway Company.</p>

<p>In 1872 this firm purchased from the owners of the Anchor
Line steamers the steamer <span class="smcap">Dom Pedro</span>, a screw steamer
engaged in the Glasgow and Peninsular service. The <span class="smcap">Dom
Pedro</span> was the first screw steamer with compound engines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
built by the famous Clyde shipbuilding firm, Randolph and
Elder, now known as the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co. Subsequently,
Messrs. James Little &amp; Co. owned a fleet of steamers
bearing Greek classical names, <em>e.g.</em>, <span class="smcap">Apollo</span>, <span class="smcap">Achilles</span>,
&amp;c., and to be in accordance with these the name of the <span class="smcap">Dom
Pedro</span> was changed to the <span class="smcap">Ariadne</span> in the year 1875. She
has now for a number of years been running on the Barrow
and Liverpool station. In the year 1866, Messrs. Little ran
the paddle steamer <span class="smcap">Herald</span> between Glasgow and Campbeltown.
The <span class="smcap">Herald</span> proved herself when on the Campbeltown
route to be one of the fastest, if not the fastest, steamer
on the Clyde. She was withdrawn the following summer
(1867) from the Glasgow and Campbeltown station, to open
the Barrow and Isle of Man trade. The latter traffic is now
maintained during the summer months by the magnificent
steamers, <span class="smcap">Manx Queen</span>, <span class="smcap">Duchess of Devonshire</span>, or <span class="smcap">Duchess
of Buccleuch</span>. The <span class="smcap">Manx Queen</span> is a large steel paddle
steamer, with a gross register tonnage of about 1,000
tons, built and engined on the Clyde by Messrs. J. and G.
Thompson. Her principal dimensions are—length, 278 feet
9 inches; beam, 29 feet 7 inches; depth, 14 feet, and her
speed is about 16 knots per hour.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duchess of Devonshire</span> is a steel twin-screw steamer,
built and engined in 1897 by the Naval Construction
and Armaments Co., Barrow. Her gross register tonnage is
1,265 tons; her length is 300 feet; beam, 35 feet 1 inch; and
depth, 15 feet 7 inches. Her engines are capable of driving
her considerably over 18 knots per hour, and she is, therefore,
one of the fastest steamers in the cross-channel trade.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duchess of Buccleuch</span> is a steel paddle steamer,
with a gross register tonnage of 804 tons, built and
engined in 1888 by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering
Co., Ltd., Glasgow. Her length is 256 feet 1 inch; beam,
29 feet 1 inch; and depth 14 feet, and her speed is about 18
knots per hour.</p>

<p>The route <em>via</em> Barrow to Douglas gives the shortest sea
passage from England to the Isle of Man, the average passage
being about three hours. In consequence of this, and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
first-class accommodation provided in these splendid steamers,
the Barrow route is a favourite one to the Island, and each
year sees an increase in the number of passengers carried.</p>

<p>Messrs. James Little &amp; Co., in conjunction with the Midland
and Furness Railways, established, in 1867, a service of
mail, passengers and cargo steamers between Barrow and
Belfast.</p>

<p>For the conduct of the business connected with this service,
Messrs. Little opened a branch office in Belfast, and, as they
had also started the Barrow to Douglas trade that same year,
they opened an office in Barrow. The first steamers employed
on the Barrow and Belfast station were the paddle-steamers
<span class="smcap">Roe</span>, <span class="smcap">Talbot</span>, and <span class="smcap">Shelburne</span>. In 1870 a larger and faster
paddle-steamer, the <span class="smcap">Antrim</span>, was added to the fleet.</p>

<p>The service is now maintained by the swift and powerful
Royal Mail Steamships <span class="smcap">City of Belfast</span>, <span class="smcap">Duchess of
Devonshire</span>, <span class="smcap">Manx Queen</span> or <span class="smcap">Londonderry</span>. The <span class="smcap">Duchess of
Devonshire</span> has already been briefly described. Her sister
vessel in the service, the <span class="smcap">City of Belfast</span>, is slightly smaller.
Her gross register tonnage is 1,055 tons.</p>

<p>These powerful steamers leave Belfast every evening at 8-30,
Irish time, and arrive in Barrow about 6 o’clock on the
following morning, in time to connect with the early morning
Midland trains to all parts of England and Scotland. The
steamers leave Barrow daily (Sundays excepted) on arrival of
the through trains from London, Bristol, Leeds, &amp;c., that is
about 8-30 p.m., and arrive in Belfast about 5-30 the following
morning (Irish time).</p>

<p>In 1873 Messrs. Little opened a branch office in Glasgow,
and in 1883 one in Liverpool. In addition to the mail and
other steamship services on the West Coast of Britain, Messrs.
James Little &amp; Co. have a regular service of steamers from
London to Terneuzen, in Holland, and for the efficient working
of this service they, in conjunction with Mr. J. W. Johnston,
opened an office in London in 1886, the name and address of
the London firm being Little &amp; Johnston, 46, Leadenhall
Street, who also have a sub-office in Terneuzen.</p>

<p>They have also several ocean steamers, not built for any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
special trade, but of large carrying capacity, under the
management of their Glasgow house.</p>

<p>The fleet of this firm at the present date (1903) consists of
fourteen full-powered steamships, having a gross registered
tonnage of 25,279 tons, and named as follows:—</p>

MR. DAVID MACBRAYNE’S WEST HIGHLAND<br>
STEAMERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the early part of last century Messrs. Thomson and
MacConnell, of Glasgow, held a large financial interest in
several of the steampackets then plying on the River and Firth
of Clyde. One of the earliest of these steamers in which they
were interested was the <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>, built about two years after
Bell’s <span class="smcap">Comet</span>. The citizens of Glasgow were quick to avail
themselves of the advantages of steam navigation: thus, while
in 1812 the limit of steam navigation was Dunoon, in 1815 it
was extended to Inverary, and in 1822 Fortwilliam, Tobermory
and Skye were included in the ports of call of the steampacket
<span class="smcap">Highlander</span>.</p>

<p>Passengers were also carried by the same steamer to the
Island of Staffa, the fare for the return passage being £3 3s.</p>

<p>Steam communication between Glasgow and Inverness <em>via</em>
the Crinan and Caledonian Canals was established in the
spring of 1824, the pioneer vessel being a small steamer named
the <span class="smcap">Ben Nevis</span>.</p>

<p>About 1830 Messrs. J. Martin and J. &amp; G. Burns advertised
the steamers <span class="smcap">Inverness</span>, <span class="smcap">Rob Roy</span> and <span class="smcap">Helen McGregor</span> to
sail regularly between the Clyde and Inverness, Skye and
Stornoway. The <span class="smcap">Helen McGregor</span> was described as having
“a splendid cabin, panelled with landscapes descriptive of the
scenery through which she passes.” She had upwards of 30
sleeping berths for cabin passengers, and an excellent steerage.</p>

<p>In 1841 the <span class="smcap">Shandon</span>, described as “an elegant vessel,” was
placed, by the same firm, on the route now taken by the
R.M.S. <span class="smcap">Columba</span>. Her passengers were carried through the
Crinan Canal on track boats drawn by horses ridden by
postillions in brilliant scarlet uniforms, and at Crinan were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
transferred to the steampacket <span class="smcap">Brenda</span>, which conveyed them
to Oban. The latter steamer belonged to Messrs. Thomson and
MacConnell, as did also the <span class="smcap">Toward Castle</span>, <span class="smcap">Morven</span> and
<span class="smcap">Staffa</span>, and later (1846) the <span class="smcap">Edinburgh Castle</span> and <span class="smcap">Maid of
Islay</span>. The two firms had been engaged in friendly competition
both on the Glasgow and Liverpool trade and the Glasgow
and West Highland service from the year 1831, but in 1841
an arrangement was arrived at, by which the West Highland
traffic was managed conjointly.</p>

<p>Her late Majesty Queen Victoria visited the Highlands in
1847, and in “Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the
Highlands,” Her Majesty wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The light on the hills was beautiful as we steamed
down Loch Fyne. At five we reached Lochgilp, and all
landed at Lochgilphead (Ardrishaig). We and our
people drove through the village to the Crinan Canal,
where we entered a most magnificently decorated barge,
drawn by three horses ridden by postillions in scarlet.
We glided along very smoothly, and the views of the
hills—the range of Cruachan—were very fine indeed.”</p>
</div>

<p>To meet the requirements of an ever-increasing traffic, the
elegant saloon steamer <span class="smcap">Linnet</span> was built, which is capable of
comfortably accommodating double the number of passengers
that the old track boat could.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Burns, who prior to that date had controlled a
large portion of the River Clyde and West Highland traffic, in
1851 decided to confine their energies to “deep sea” steamers,
and accordingly sold off their smaller craft, and Messrs.
Thomson and MacConnell parted with their steamers of the
same type. These vessels were acquired, and the West Highland
trade taken over, by Messrs. David Hutcheson &amp; Co. (the
company including Mr. David MacBrayne, the head of the
present firm), whose address at that date was 14, Jamaica
Street, Glasgow.</p>

<p>Messrs. Hutcheson had, previous to the purchase of the
steamers referred to, five steampackets named <span class="smcap">Cygnet</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lapwing</span>, <span class="smcap">Duntroon Castle</span>, <span class="smcap">Pioneer</span> and <span class="smcap">Dolphin</span>, so that in
1851 they controlled a fleet of about a dozen steamers. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
steamers maintained a bi-weekly service (in addition to other
sailings) between Glasgow and Inverness, sailing from Glasgow
every Monday and Thursday, a service which has been maintained
uninterruptedly for upwards of half a century. The
<span class="smcap">Cygnet</span> and <span class="smcap">Lapwing</span> were built with their paddle boxes flush
with their hulls, to enable them to pass through the Crinan Canal.</p>

<p>Two new steamers, the <span class="smcap">Chevalier</span> and <span class="smcap">Mountaineer</span>, were
added to the fleet in 1854. The following year (1855) the
<span class="smcap">Clansman</span> was built for the firm. The same year the <span class="smcap">Iona</span> (the
first of the name) was built, and maintained her reputation as
a “crack” Clyde steamer until 1863, when she was purchased
by an agent of the Confederate States, to run the blockade
during the American War. She, however, never crossed the
Atlantic, being sunk, as the result of a collision, before she got
clear of the upper firth.</p>

<p>She was promptly replaced by <span class="smcap">Iona</span> (second of the name),
launched the same year, which, after running for one season
only, was also sold to run the blockade, but is supposed to have
been lost with all hands off Lundy Island. The second <span class="smcap">Iona</span>
differed from her predecessors in having a saloon on deck.</p>

<p>Prior to her starting on her Atlantic voyage, this saloon was
removed and placed on <span class="smcap">Iona</span> the third. This steamer for many
years bore the reputation of being the swiftest, as well as the
most luxuriously appointed, steamer on the Firth of Clyde.
The engines, which work with almost incredible smoothness,
are of 1,625 horse-power, and are capable of propelling her at
the rate of 18 knots per hour.</p>

<p>In connection with this vessel, the writer remembers a very
amusing incident. Many years ago he was travelling by
steamer from Liverpool to Glasgow, and in conversation a
fellow-passenger stated that he had in the early part of the same
summer sailed in the famous <span class="smcap">Iona</span> from Glasgow to Ardrishaig.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the Kyles of Bute?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The Kyles of Bute,” he replied; “I never saw them.”</p>

<p>The subject was dropped, until a little later he again spoke
of his trip to Ardrishaig.</p>

<p>“And what do you think of the Kyles of Bute?” I again
queried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“The Kyles of Bute; you asked me that before. I never
saw them.”</p>

<p>“But you say you sailed to Ardrishaig in the <span class="smcap">Iona</span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have seen the Kyles—you could not
possibly have gone to Ardrishaig without seeing them.”</p>

<p>He seemed astonished, but after a moment’s thought a bright
idea struck him, and he exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Ah! yes, I remember now, I saw a red board with gilt
letters ‘Kyles of Bute’ on it; but I didn’t go ashore—I never
saw them.”</p>

<p>Fortunately all men are not so unobservant; and so we find
tourists from Great Britain and Ireland; from Canada and the
United States; from South Africa and the Antipodes,
journeying to enjoy not alone the beauties of the Kyles of
Bute, but also the grand and beautiful scenery of the Western
Highlands, now so easy of access by the splendid steamers of
the MacBrayne fleet.</p>

<p>In 1862 was built the first of the trio of handsome screw
steamers which sail regularly round the Mull of Cantyre to
Stornoway and the far North. She is named the <span class="smcap">Clydesdale</span>.
A larger steamer, the <span class="smcap">Clansman</span> (second of the name), was
built in 1870, and one still larger, the <span class="smcap">Claymore</span>, in 1881.</p>

<p>Mr. David Hutcheson retired in 1876, leaving his partner,
Mr. David MacBrayne, sole control of the business, which has
since grown steadily, necessitating from time to time the
addition of new steamers.</p>

<p>In 1878 the Royal Mail steamer <span class="smcap">Columba</span> was built by
Messrs. J. &amp; G. Thomson (now John Brown &amp; Co.), of Clydebank,
who were also the builders of the <span class="smcap">Iona</span>. She is the
largest passenger steamer on the Firth of Clyde, and few, if
any, cross-channel steamers exceed her in length. According
to the official description of her, she is 316 feet in length,
50 feet in breadth (inclusive of paddle boxes), and 9 feet in
depth. She is built entirely of steel, and is fitted with two
oscillating engines of 220 nominal horse-power, but capable of
working up to 3,000 indicated horse-power.</p>

<p>Two years previously the R.M.S. <span class="smcap">Columba</span> was refitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
by Messrs. Hutson &amp; Sons, Limited, with two large tubulous
boilers of the haystack type, made entirely of steel, and with
twelve furnaces. When working at full pressure, she attains
a speed of 22 miles per hour, and she is certified to carry over
2,000 passengers. The <span class="smcap">Columba</span> is steered by a steam
steering engine, has the novelty of a set of steam bits at bow
and stern by which the vessel is warped into piers, and has all
the modern improvements introduced on board.</p>

<p>The upper saloon is very luxuriously fitted up, and in the
interior are reading table, writing desk and lounges. The
large square windows are carried round the sides and stern,
affording a fine view of the scenery through which the steamer
passes.</p>

<p>The breakfast and dining saloon, which is 8 feet high and
well ventilated, has a series of separate circular tables, and
meals are served at any time. The dining saloon (forward) for
steerage or fore-cabin passengers is light and airy.</p>

<p>The ladies’ and gentlemen’s cabins are elegantly fitted up
with the usual hand-basins and other conveniences.</p>

<p>There is a shampooing and hairdressing establishment, with
a supply of every toilet requisite; a splendid bathroom, affording
passengers who have travelled during the night the luxury
of a salt-water bath, and a cloak room where they can leave
hand-bags and other small articles. There are in addition a
book stall and a fruit stall for cabin passengers, and for steerage
passengers, a ladies’ cabin forward and several stalls (fruit
stalls, &amp;c.) are provided.</p>

<p>The only floating post office in the kingdom is to be found
on board the <span class="smcap">Columba</span>, and in it is transacted a larger amount
of business than is transacted in many a provincial town. In
it letters, telegrams and parcels are received, stamped, sorted
and distributed at every calling place, for transmission to all
parts, and it is of immense convenience to tourists and the
inhabitants along the route. Upwards of 100,000 letters pass
through this office in a month, of which a large proportion are
local letters passing between the coast towns and villages at
which the steamer calls. Over 450 telegrams were handed in,
and upward of £70 received for postage and telegraph stamps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>in one month. The most sanguine expectations of the Post
Office Department being more than realised, has induced the
Postmaster-General to add to the staff. Three post office
officials travel with the <span class="smcap">Columba</span>. Postal orders can be purchased,
and those issued at other offices in the kingdom cashed
on board this steamer.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>In 1902 Mr. David MacBrayne assumed as partners his two
sons, Mr. David Hope, and Mr. Laurence MacBrayne, the
name of the firm remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>Messrs. MacBrayne’s steamers navigate every sound and loch
between Port Ellen in the Island of Islay, off the South-west
coast of Scotland, and Thurso in the extreme North, and visit
almost every island between those two points.</p>

<p>The new steamer <span class="smcap">Lapwing</span>, built in the early part of the
year 1903, proved very successful, and the firm have in course
of construction another fine steamer, which is expected to be
ready for the service early next year (1904). The fleet at
present consists of thirty-one screw and paddle steamships,
named as follows:—</p>

MESSRS. DAVID MACIVER &amp; CO.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The firm of Messrs. David MacIver &amp; Co. was originally
founded by the late Mr. David MacIver and his brother Charles,
in 1835. Mr. David MacIver had some four years prior to
this date formed a steamship company to trade between Liverpool
and Glasgow, which he called the City of Glasgow Steampacket
Co. The pioneer steamer was named the <span class="smcap">City of
Glasgow</span>, and sailed on her first voyage from Liverpool on
the 25th April, 1831. Three other steamers were quickly added
to the fleet, viz., the <span class="smcap">Solway</span>, <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span> and <span class="smcap">John Wood</span>,
the latter steamer being named after a celebrated shipbuilder
of Port Glasgow. In 1835 the <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span> (second)
was added to the fleet, and the same year Mr. Charles MacIver
joined his brother, and the style of the firm was altered to
Messrs. David MacIver &amp; Co., from that of the City of Glasgow
Steampacket Co. On the 1st of June, 1837, the celebrated
steamer <span class="smcap">Commodore</span> was launched by Mr. John Wood, and
made her first voyage, sailing from the Prince’s Pierhead,
Liverpool, on the 6th March, 1838. The <span class="smcap">Commodore</span> was
at that time considered to be the most powerful, most comfortable,
and fastest sea-going steamer afloat. The sister ship of
this splendid steamer, the <span class="smcap">Admiral</span>, was launched in the
beginning of the year 1840, and proved a faster vessel than her
consort. On her trial trip on the 2nd April, 1840, with a full
deadweight cargo, she ran 16 miles in 56½ minutes, being five
minutes less time than it was ever done by any other steamer.</p>

<p>In 1840 a Mail Steamship Service between Liverpool,
Canada and the United States was established, the respective
agents being Mr. Samuel Cunard, Halifax; Messrs. J. &amp; G.
Burns, Glasgow; and Messrs. David and Charles MacIver,
Liverpool, the latter being the practical managers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
company. This service, which afterwards acquired a worldwide
reputation as the “Cunard Line,” was modestly
inaugurated by the despatch of the Liverpool and Glasgow
steamer <span class="smcap">Unicorn</span> (Captain Douglas), which sailed from
Liverpool for Halifax and Boston on Saturday morning, 16th
May, 1840. After she completed her outward voyage, she
continued to ply between Pictou and Quebec, in connection
with the British and North American Royal Mail Steamers.</p>

<p>In 1850 was instituted the steamship service between
Liverpool and Havre, the pioneer steamer being the <span class="smcap">Commodore</span>,
the well-known and favourite Liverpool and Glasgow
steampacket. The coasting services were then carried on in
the name of Charles MacIver &amp; Co. About the same date,
steamship services to the Mediterranean were begun. The
Havre and the Mediterranean business was conducted in the
name of Burns and MacIver.</p>

<p>The elder of the two brothers (the founders of the “MacIver”
steamship business), Mr. David MacIver, died unmarried in
1845. His brother, the late Mr. Charles MacIver, of Calderstones,
then became the head of the firm, which position he held
until his decease in 1885. In 1863 Mr. Charles MacIver
admitted his eldest son, Mr. David MacIver, the present M.P.
for the Kirkdale Division of Liverpool, into partnership. Mr.
David MacIver remained a partner in the firms of D. &amp; C.
MacIver, Charles MacIver &amp; Co. and Burns &amp; MacIver for
eleven years, when he retired from all three firms, and
established an entirely separate steamship business, resuscitating
the old title of David MacIver &amp; Co. The first steamer
built under the new regime was the <span class="smcap">Tuscany</span>. She was
built in 1876 by Messrs. J. &amp; G. Thomson, Glasgow, and
engined by the same eminent firm. After running in Messrs.
David MacIver &amp; Co.’s service for a number of years, she was
purchased by Portuguese owners, and she is believed to have
again changed owners and to be now sailing under the Spanish
flag as the <span class="smcap">Margarita</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sicily</span>, the second steamer of the fleet, was built and
engined by Messrs. Laird, Birkenhead, in 1876, and was sold to
the Cullum Steam Shipping Co., of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>The following year (1877) the <span class="smcap">Thessaly</span> and <span class="smcap">Barbary</span>
were built for the firm by the builders of the <span class="smcap">Sicily</span>. The
latter steamer was sold, first to Messrs. Booth &amp; Co., who
changed her name to the <span class="smcap">Clement</span>, and subsequently to the
Cia de Cabotagem do Grão Para, by whom she was named the
<span class="smcap">Marajo</span>, and placed under the Brazilian flag.</p>

<p>After an interval of five years, the <span class="smcap">Albany</span> was contracted
for, also with the Messrs. Laird, of Birkenhead. Mr. David
MacIver’s connection with Birkenhead is one of very long
standing, and he has always laboured to promote its welfare and
prosperity. In recognition of his services, he was the elected
representative of the Borough from 1874 to 1885. The
<span class="smcap">Albany</span> was considerably larger than any of her predecessors,
her principal dimensions being—Length 300 feet 7 inches,
breadth 39 feet 2 inches, and depth 26 feet 4 inches; with a
deadweight capacity of about 3,500 tons. She was purchased
by Messrs. T. W. Lunn &amp; Co., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, by whom
she was re-named the <span class="smcap">Willowdene</span>.</p>

<p>A reference to the list of steamers built for Messrs. David
MacIver &amp; Co. will show the distinguishing characteristic of the
names to be the terminal letter Y. An amusing incident
occurred in this connection during the building of the steamer
<span class="smcap">Albany</span>. A firm of north country shipowners, whose
steamers were named after British dukes (omitting the prefix
“Duke of”), had selected “<span class="smcap">Albany</span>” for a vessel then under
construction, and they made the cool request to Messrs. David
MacIver &amp; Co. to change the name of their steamer. It is
needless to say they were unable to comply with this request.</p>

<p>For the first few years, the steamers named were not
employed in any regular trade, though originally designed
for the Mediterranean—hence the names <span class="smcap">Tuscany</span>, <span class="smcap">Sicily</span>,
<span class="smcap">Barbary</span>, <span class="smcap">Thessaly</span>, &amp;c.—but traded, as inducement offered, to
the Mediterranean, the Danube, the Black Sea, and elsewhere.
They have formed part of the Anchor Line to Bombay, and of
the Hall Line to the same port; and they have operated in the
North Atlantic in the service of Messrs. Richardson, Spence
and Co., between Liverpool and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In 1883 Messrs. David MacIver &amp; Co. despatched their first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
steamer to the River Plate, and two years later they established
a regular service between Liverpool and Buenos Ayres, Montevideo
and Rosario.</p>

<p>In 1893, Mr. Charles Livingston, who had been associated
with Mr. MacIver for two years previously, became a partner in
the firm. Mr. Livingston takes a very active part in the
management of the steamers, and he has devoted himself with
great energy and success to the development of the River Plate
trade with Great Britain. The five steamers named having
become too small for the requirements of the service in which
they were engaged, were disposed of, as stated, to various buyers
and replaced by modern steamers of greater capacity and higher
speed. These later steamers have all been designed specially
for the River Plate trade, and although large carriers, are of
remarkably light draught, thus enabling them to ascend to
Rosario, without putting consignees and shippers to the risk
and expense of transhipping cargo.</p>

<p>In 1894 contracts were placed with Sir Raylton Dixon &amp; Co.,
Middlesbrough, for three steamers of exactly similar dimensions
and engine power. The first of these was the <span class="smcap">Saxony</span>,
launched December, 1894. She is a steel screw steamer of
3,500 tons deadweight, and fitted with triple-expansion engines
(constructed by Blair &amp; Co., Ltd., Stockton) working up to
about 1,500 horse-power effective. The following month
(January, 1895) her sister ship, the <span class="smcap">Normandy</span>, was delivered,
and February of the same year witnessed the completion of the
third vessel, the <span class="smcap">Lombardy</span>.</p>

<p>The steamer which succeeded these was 1,000 tons larger.
She is named the <span class="smcap">Brittany</span>, and was built in 1898 by
Messrs. Richardson, Duck &amp; Co., Stockton. She is a steel
screw steamer, 330 feet long, by 43 feet beam and 16 feet
6 inches depth, with a deadweight carrying capacity of 4,500
tons. She is, like all her sister ships, propelled by triple-expansion
engines constructed by Blair &amp; Co., Ltd., Stockton.</p>

<p>The opening of the 20th century was marked by a further
and an important advance in the carrying capacity of the firm’s
steamers. Contracts were placed with Messrs. Richardson,
Duck &amp; Co. for three steamers, two of which are each of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
6,500 tons, and the third of about 5,500 tons deadweight. The
first of the trio, the <span class="smcap">Barbary</span> (second of that name) was
delivered in May, 1901, and the <span class="smcap">Tartary</span> in July following.
Both these vessels are practically identical as regards size and
power. They are each 370 feet long, with a beam of 48 feet
1 inch, and a depth of 19 feet and a half. Their engines (triple-expansion)
develop 3,000 horse-power. In November of the
same year the <span class="smcap">Burgundy</span>, a vessel of somewhat smaller dimensions,
was completed.</p>

<p>The fleet of Messrs. David MacIver &amp; Co.’s line to the River
Plate at present consists of seven full-powered steamers, but
before the close of the present year an eighth steamer, the <span class="smcap">Araby</span>,
now in course of construction, and of about the same dimensions
as the <span class="smcap">Burgundy</span>, will be placed on the service. Formerly the
steamers were each registered as a single ship company, but
in 1900 they were all incorporated in David MacIver, Sons
and Co., Ltd.</p>

<p>The Directors of the Limited Company are David MacIver,
Esq., M.P., his son Charles MacIver, Esq., and Charles
Livingston, Esq. The steamers of Messrs. David MacIver and
Co.’s line are deservedly popular with shippers and consignees
in the River Plate trade, who are able to depend upon them for
regularity of service and careful handling of their goods, and
with underwriters for their freedom from serious accidents.
All the steamers are comparatively new, and are fitted with the
most modern and perfect appliances for the rapid and effective
loading and discharging of general cargo.</p>

<p>Special attention has been given by the Company to the
transit of cattle to and from the River Plate, and each of the
steamers is fitted with permanent fittings for the conveyance of
live stock. The headquarters of Messrs. David MacIver and
Co.’s line are, and have always been situated in Liverpool, from
which port it maintains a regular fortnightly service to and
from Buenos Ayres, Montevideo and Rosario, throughout the
year.</p>

MACIVER’S LIVERPOOL AND GLASGOW<br>
STEAMERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the autumn of 1826 the New Clyde Shipping Company
advertised that their steampacket <span class="smcap">Enterprise</span> (Captain
M’Farlane) would sail weekly between Liverpool and
Glasgow. She was a very small steamer, being only 210 tons
burthen, and the owners announced that, in consequence of
her light draft, she would proceed direct to Glasgow, and not
transfer her passengers to river steamers at Greenock, as the
larger steamers had to do. The first agents of the company
were Messrs. M’Nair and Brebner, 33, Water Street, but in
January, 1829, the agency was transferred to Mr. David
MacIver, 18, Water Street. A few months later the Glasgow
and Liverpool Shipping Company was formed, and in 1831
that company acquired the Mersey and Clyde Steam Navigation
Company’s steampackets <span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span>, <span class="smcap">James Watt</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Wm. Huskisson</span>, as well as the <span class="smcap">Enterprise</span>. The New
Clyde Shipping Company having ceased operations, Mr.
MacIver formed a new steamship line of his own, which he
called the City of Glasgow Steampacket Company. The
pioneer steamer was named the <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span> and sailed
on her first voyage from Liverpool on the 25th April, 1831.
Three other steamers were quickly added to the fleet, viz.,
the <span class="smcap">Solway</span>, <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span>, and <span class="smcap">John Wood</span>, the latter steamer
being named after a celebrated shipbuilder at Port Glasgow.
In 1835 the <span class="smcap">City of Glasgow</span> (second) was put on the
station, and the sailings were increased to three per week
from each port. Mr. Charles MacIver joined his brother
this year, and the style of the firm was changed to
D. MacIver &amp; Co.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>In 1837 the celebrated steamship <span class="smcap">Commodore</span> was built,
followed in 1840 by her equally famous sister ship, <span class="smcap">Admiral</span>.</p>

<p>All the steamers engaged in the Liverpool and Glasgow
trade prior to 1839 were built of wood, but in that year a new
steamship company entered into competition with the
existing companies, and placed the <span class="smcap">Royal Sovereign</span>, an
iron steamer, on the station., The immediate result was a
heavy drop in passenger and freight rates. Steerage passengers
were carried for 1s. each, and boxes and bale goods for
1d. per foot measurement. The following year (1840) a mail
steamship service between Liverpool, Canada, and U.S.A.
was established, the respective agents of the company being
D. and C. MacIver, Liverpool; J. and G. Burns, Glasgow; and
Samuel Cunard, Halifax. This service, which afterwards acquired
a world-wide reputation as the “Cunard line,” was modestly
inaugurated by the despatch of the Liverpool and Glasgow
steampacket <span class="smcap">Unicorn</span> (Captain Douglas). This vessel (the
real pioneer of the Cunard line) sailed from Liverpool for
Halifax and Boston on Saturday morning, 16th May, 1840.
After she completed her outward voyage, she continued to
ply between Pictou and Quebec in connection between the
British and N.A. Royal mail steamers. Although there were
three perfectly distinct steamship companies trading between
Liverpool and Glasgow, yet so friendly were the respective
owners towards each other that in 1846 they issued a joint
sailing bill, which included the whole of the sailings for
all the companies. This arrangement continued unchanged
for seven years (1853), at the end of which period the
<span class="smcap">Princess Royal</span> was advertised separately. At this date
the quickest, cheapest (although the fares were double what
they now are), and most comfortable mode of travelling
between Liverpool and Glasgow was by steamer. The
steamers were large, swift, and luxuriously furnished, and so
numerous were the passengers that the joint companies maintained
a daily service. From the year 1853 the two services,
the MacIver and the Burns, were amalgamated, the joint line
being represented in Liverpool by Chas. MacIver &amp; Co., and
in Glasgow by G. and J. Burns. In 1850 Messrs. Chas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
MacIver &amp; Co. instituted the steamship service between
Liverpool and Havre, the pioneer steamer being the
<span class="smcap">Commodore</span>, the well-known Liverpool and Glasgow steampacket.
About the same date the steamship services to the
Mediterranean were begun by Messrs. MacIver, under the style
of Messrs. Burns and MacIver. Until the year 1853 no distinctive
class of name had been adopted for the coasting steamers
of the MacIver line, but in that year the <span class="smcap">Elk</span> and <span class="smcap">Stag</span> were
built, followed by the <span class="smcap">Lynx</span> and <span class="smcap">Stork</span>. These were the last
of the paddle-steamers built to run between Liverpool and
Glasgow. In 1855 the owners decided to place screw-steamers
on this station, and accordingly built the screw-steamers
<span class="smcap">Otter</span>, <span class="smcap">Beaver</span>, and <span class="smcap">Zebra</span>. The <span class="smcap">Zebra</span> was a
large and powerful vessel, and was amongst the earliest of
the steamers taken up by Government for transport duty
during the Crimean war. All the succeeding steamers have
been of the same type, and have been named after animals
or birds. The joint service remained in force for nearly half
a century, until (in 1895) Messrs. G. and J. Burns opened an
office in Liverpool, and placed the steamers <span class="smcap">Mastiff</span>,
<span class="smcap">Pointer</span> and <span class="smcap">Spaniel</span> on the station. The elder of the
two brothers (the founders of the “MacIver” steamship
business), Mr. David MacIver, died unmarried in 1845. His
brother, the late Mr. Charles MacIver, of Calderstone, then
became the head of the firm, which position he held until his
death in 1885. The long connection of the “MacIvers” with
the Cunard Company was terminated in 1883, and they
retired from the management. Messrs. Charles and Henry
MacIver (the younger sons of the late Mr. Charles MacIver)
retain the old styles of D. and C. MacIver (for their foreign
trades) and Chas. MacIver &amp; Co. for the steamers trading
between Liverpool and Glasgow.</p><br>

SLIGO STEAM NAVIGATION CO., LTD.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">During the first half of the last century Messrs. Middleton
and Pollexfen, of Sligo, owned a large fleet of sailing vessels.
Some of these vessels were barques which traded to foreign
ports, but others were swift, staunch schooners which traded
regularly between Sligo and Liverpool, and Sligo and Bristol
Channel and Glasgow. But the schooners laboured under one
serious disadvantage—the uncertainty of the duration of the
passage. With favourable weather it might be accomplished
in a few days, but with adverse gales or fogs it might occupy
as many weeks. It is self-evident that, in competition with
steamers, schooners have no chance of success, so in 1856
Messrs. Middleton and Pollexfen decided to employ steam in
their Sligo and Liverpool trade, and for this purpose built a
small steamer, which they named the <span class="smcap">Sligo</span>. The following
year (1857) they put the <span class="smcap">Sligo</span> on the Sligo and Glasgow
station in opposition to Messrs. Cameron and Co. Five years
later (1862) a company was formed with the title of the Sligo
Steam Navigation Company, Limited, which took over the
steamship business of Messrs. Middleton and Pollexfen, and
which has continued to flourish, financially and otherwise.
The company in 1865 built a larger steamer than the <span class="smcap">Sligo</span>,
and named her <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>. The opposition in the Sligo
services began under the <em>regime</em> of Messrs. Middleton and
Pollexfen, continued for some years after the formation of the
Sligo Steam Navigation Company, but was finally settled
amicably. Messrs. Alexander A. Laird and Co. (successors to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
Messrs. Cameron and Co.) retired from the Sligo and Liverpool
trade, and the Sligo Company withdrew from the Glasgow
trade, purchasing the <span class="smcap">Garland</span>, which they renamed the
<span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>. Having disposed of the <span class="smcap">Sligo</span>, the company
purchased a swift Clyde-built cargo and passenger steamer,
to which they transferred the name. The <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span> was sold
in 1892 to Preston buyers, but has been for several years, and
is now, employed by the Cunard Company to maintain their
Liverpool and Havre service. The same year the largest
steamer yet built by the company was placed on the Liverpool
and Sligo station. The new vessel (the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>) was constructed
by Messrs. John Jones and Sons, of Liverpool, and
was built to the specifications and under the supervision of
Mr. H. H. West, the naval architect for the Sligo Steam
Navigation Company. She is a smart-looking boat of the
following dimensions:—Length between perpendiculars, 206
feet; breadth, moulded, 29 feet; and depth, 15 feet 3½ inches.
Her gross register is 700 tons, and net 332 tons. The
carriage of cattle being a very important feature of the trade,
careful consideration has been given to the cattle fittings.
Being a larger vessel than any of her predecessors, increased
accommodation is also provided for saloon and deck
passengers, as the trade is increasing in this direction very
considerably. The saloon and cabins are fitted up in a
substantial and comfortable manner. The engines (triple
expansion), also constructed by Messrs. Jones and Sons, are
of 1,000 indicated h.p. On her trial trip the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>
attained a speed of 13 knots, being a knot in excess of contract
speed. The ship is lighted throughout by electricity. The
loading berth for the company’s steamers was, originally, in
the Trafalgar Dock, but is now on the east side of the Clarence
Basin, a berth they have occupied since about 1867. The
company despatches the <span class="smcap">Liverpool</span> or <span class="smcap">Sligo</span> once a week
between the two ports, sailing from Liverpool every Tuesday,
and from Sligo every Saturday. In addition to this, its main
service, the company has a Government contract, on which
the steamer <span class="smcap">Tartar</span> is employed. This steamer sails twice a
week in winter, and three times per week in summer, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
Sligo to Belmullet, calling at Rosses Point, Ballycastle, and
Belderrig, to land and embark passengers. It is a favourite
tourist route in summer, affording a splendid view of the wild
coast scenery of the West of Ireland. The distance run is
about 70 miles, and the time occupied about six hours. The
steamers of the Sligo Steam Navigation Company, sailing
between Liverpool and Sligo, are exposed to all the force and
fury of the Atlantic gales, as they steam along the north and
north-west coasts of Ireland. It is, therefore, an eloquent
testimonial to the strength of their construction, as well as to
the ability with which they are managed, and navigated, that
they sail with unfailing regularity in winter as in summer,
and with a most gratifying freedom from accidents.</p><br>

WATERFORD STEAMSHIP COMPANY.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Early in the year 1836 several Waterford merchants
determined to run steamers between Waterford and Liverpool
in opposition to the steamers owned by the Messrs. Pope, of
the former port. Accordingly, on the 11th January, 1837,
there was launched from Mr. John Laird’s yard, Birkenhead,
the <span class="smcap">Duncannon</span>, a small iron paddle-steamer of 200 tons
burthen, to the order of the Waterford Commercial Steam
Navigation Company, represented in Liverpool by Archer,
Daly &amp; Co., of 2, Cook Street. Three years later (1840) a
second steamer, the <span class="smcap">Wm. Penn</span>, was added to the service.
The new company was so successful in its venture that in a
short time the Messrs. Pope either abandoned the trade, or
were absorbed by their rivals, who thereupon appear to have
adopted the title of the Waterford Steamship Company.
There had been for years keen rivalry between the St. George
Steampacket Company and the City of Dublin Steampacket
Company, and when the business of the former was transferred
to the Cork Steamship Company, the directors of the
City of Dublin Company were by no means favourably disposed
to the new management. This unfriendly feeling was
extended to the Waterford Steamship Company, because Mr.
Joseph Malcomson (chairman of the latter company) was
offered, and accepted, a seat on the board of the Cork Steamship
Company, and his firm (Messrs. Malcomson Brothers)
invested largely in the Cork Company’s shares. The following
year the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway was opened from
Waterford to Thomastown. The directors asked the Waterford
Steamship Company to change their loading berth from
the south side of the River Suir to the north side, adjacent
to the railway company’s terminus. This the steamship
company refused to do. In consequence of this refusal, the
Waterford and Kilkenny Railway Company induced the City
of Dublin Company to put on steamers between Waterford
and Liverpool. But, as the City of Dublin Company had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>steamers of their own available, they chartered steamers from
the British and Irish Steampacket Company, which they
placed on the Liverpool and Waterford station. Meantime,
the Waterford Steamship Company had not been idle. The
late Liverpool agent of the company (Mr. George K. Payne)
was detailed to organise an opposition to the railway company,
with emphatic instructions not to permit a single passenger
to be carried by the railway company between Waterford and
Thomastown, or <em>vice versa</em>. The distance was only twelve
miles, and an efficient car service was at once established
between the two towns. Not only was the service an efficient
one, but, rather than permit passengers to travel by the
railway company, the drivers of the cars would take them for
nothing. Of course, there were not wanting those who
prophesied that the Waterford Company and the Messrs.
Malcomson (who had acquired the whole of the steamship
company’s shares) would be ruined by the opposition.
Malcomson Brothers, however, referred inquirers as to their
stability to Messrs. Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., then at the zenith
of their power, whose reply was:—“We guarantee Messrs.
Malcomson Brothers to the extent of two million pounds
sterling.”</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2940_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>

<p>Equally fierce was the opposition in the cross-channel
service. Passengers were frequently carried without charge
between Liverpool and Waterford, as well as between Liverpool
and Dublin. A story is told of a passenger going into
the Dublin Company’s office in Waterford, and asking what
the cabin fare was to Liverpool. He was told he would be
taken for nothing, to which he replied, “That is not good
enough; you must feed me as well.” A similar tradition
exists with regard to the Liverpool and Dublin service,
namely, that when one of the rival companies advertised its
willingness to carry passengers for nothing, and to give them
a loaf of bread, the other company capped the offer by the
addition of a bottle of Guinness’ stout. Not content with
carrying the war into the enemy’s country by running horsecars
between Waterford and Thomastown, the Waterford
Steamship Company placed their steamer <span class="smcap">Lion</span> on the Liverpool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
and Dublin station, and chartered a steamer from the
Cork Steamship Company to run in opposition to the British
and Irish Company between Dublin and London. Thereupon,
the British and Irish Company chartered a steamer from
Langtry’s Belfast Steamship Company to run between Liverpool
and Cork, and the Cork Company, as a counter move,
placed their steamer <span class="smcap">Minerva</span> on the Liverpool and Belfast
station. The opposition was maintained with unabated
fierceness for about three years, at the end of which time the
City of Dublin Company and the Waterford Company
arrived at an amicable settlement, each company agreeing to
cease opposing the other. The Belfast Steamship Company
and the British and Irish Company having now to bear the
brunt of the opposition, without the support of the City of
Dublin Company, deemed it wise to make the best terms they
could with their opponents. Accordingly, the Belfast Company
divided the Liverpool and Belfast trade with the Cork
Company, and the British and Irish Steampacket Company
shared their London and Dublin trade with the Waterford
Steamship Company. The Cork Company continued to run
steamers between Liverpool and Belfast for several years, but
were eventually bought off by the Belfast Steamship
Company. The Waterford Company ran two steamers
regularly between London and Dublin until the year 1870,
when they also were bought off by the British and Irish
Steampacket Company. Prior to the City of Dublin Company’s
opposition, the Bristol Steam Navigation Company
and the Waterford Steamship Company had maintained a
joint service between Waterford and Bristol. The Bristol
Company’s boat left Waterford on Tuesday to catch the
Bristol cattle market, and the Waterford Company’s boat left
Waterford on Friday. As a consequence of the low rates
which were in force during the opposition, a great deal of
traffic was diverted from the Bristol route to the Liverpool
route, and the Bristol Company suspended their sailings to
and from Waterford. The Waterford Company thereupon
took up the Tuesday sailings to Bristol. When the Liverpool
opposition ceased, the Bristol Company wished to resume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
their Tuesday sailings from Waterford. The Waterford
Company, however, refused to withdraw their Tuesday
steamer, but agreed to let the Bristol Company have the
Friday sailing. The close and friendly relationship which
had formerly existed between these two companies became
somewhat strained, and ultimately ended in so wide a breach
that the Waterford Company purchased the paddle steamer
<span class="smcap">Victory</span> from the Cork Steamship Company, and placed her
on the station between Bristol and Dublin, in opposition to
the Bristol Steam Navigation Company. This opposition was
withdrawn upon the Bristol Company undertaking to pay the
Waterford Company an annual sum of £1,000, which sum
they continued to pay for a great many years. About the
year 1847, Malcomson Brothers (the owners of the Waterford
Steamship Company) purchased the steamer <span class="smcap">Dublin</span>, for
employment in one of their London trades. She was the
first screw steamer owned by any Irish company or firm, and
she proved so successful that her new owners had all their
subsequent steamers fitted with screws, except one boat for a
special trade. Being shareholders in the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Malcomson Brothers
induced the directors of that company to introduce screw
steamers into their fleet. It was also by the advice of Messrs.
Malcomson that Richardson Brothers, the promoters and
first managers of the Inman line, built screw steamers for the
Atlantic. The Messrs. Malcomson were no mere theorists in
steamship construction; they decided to build the steamers
they owned. For this reason they established (in 1847) an
iron shipbuilding and engineering works at Waterford, under
the style of the Neptune Iron Works. They were fortunate
in securing for their manager a talented shipbuilder, the late
Mr. John Horn, who was succeeded by his son, Mr. Andrew
Horn, an engineer of very exceptional abilities, and who is
the present superintendent engineer of the company. About
40 steamers were built at the Neptune Iron Works before
they were closed, several of which became famous, and all of
which were noted for their strength of hull and engines.</p>

<p>In 1849 the Waterford Steamship Company (Malcomson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
Brothers) built at their Neptune Iron Works, Waterford, the
steamer <span class="smcap">Mars</span>. Her original plans, which were for a paddle-boat,
were altered while she was on the stocks, and she was
launched a screw steamer. She was the first screw steamer
placed on the Liverpool and Waterford station, and at first
the cattle shippers did not like the idea of shipping by her,
especially as on one of her early voyages she heeled over on
leaving Waterford Quay, and killed a large number of cattle;
but the late Captain Burns was put in command, and she
proved herself to be a safe carrier, and speedily became a
favourite boat in the trade. Two years prior to this date
(1847) Malcomson Brothers built at the same yard the steamer
<span class="smcap">Neptune</span>—this was the first steamer built at the Neptune
Iron Works, and she was also the first steamer to run to
St. Petersburg. It happened in this way. The Russian
Government were very anxious to get a line of steamers
established between England and St. Petersburg, and made
overtures on the subject to Malcomson Brothers. As a result,
the latter agreed to start a line from London, of which the
pioneer steamer was wrecked in the Baltic on her first outward
voyage. The <span class="smcap">Neptune</span> was then despatched. When
she arrived at Cronstadt the Mayor of St. Petersburg came
on board in state, and as she steamed up the Neva, H.I.M.
the Czar Nicholas met her in his state barge; the forts and
warships fired salutes of honour, and all the merchant ships
were covered with flags. To commemorate this important
event, his Majesty the Czar commanded that whenever the
<span class="smcap">Neptune</span> came to St. Petersburg she was to be free of port
and pilotage dues.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write, it was impossible to over-estimate
the influence of Malcomson Brothers in the commercial
steamship world. We have seen how they were
consulted by the directors of the P. and O., and by the promoters
of the Inman line. In addition to their coasting
fleets they had steamers in the Eastern trade, one of which—the
<span class="smcap">Una</span>—was one of the first steamers to pass through the
Suez Canal. They were also the pioneers of the Liverpool
and River Plate trade, and were, I believe, the predecessors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
of Lamport and Holt. Amongst the large fleet of steamers
built for the Waterford Steamship Company at their own
shipbuilding and engineering works was a screw steamer, the
<span class="smcap">William Penn</span>. This steamer was sold by the Waterford
Steamship Company, and her new owners, having lengthened
her and given her a fourth mast, renamed her the <span class="smcap">European</span>.
As the <span class="smcap">European</span> she ran for a number of years in H. N.
Hughes and Nephew’s line between Liverpool and Bombay.
She afterwards was transferred to, or chartered by,
Geo. Warren and Co., and while in their Boston and Liverpool
service, in the early seventies, she had the proud distinction
of being the first steamer to bring to Liverpool an
importation of American live cattle, consigned to Geo.
Roddick and Co., Chapel Walks. Since the withdrawal of
the Malcomsons from the active control of the company, the
management of the Waterford Steamship Company has been
vested in Mr. C. Morley, under whose able management the
steamers have been maintained in a state of thorough
efficiency and up-to-dateness. The fleet of the company at
the present date consists of the following powerful steamers,
which make their passages to and from Liverpool and Waterford
with unfailing regularity in about 18 hours, summer and
winter, viz.:—<span class="smcap">Lara</span>, <span class="smcap">Comeragh</span>, <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>, <span class="smcap">Dunbrody</span> and
<span class="smcap">Menapia</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dunbrody</span> has a complete installation of electric light,
including the holds, and her lower holds for the entire length
form a refrigerator. A further and larger addition, the <span class="smcap">Clodagh</span>,
now building, will shortly be added to the fleet, embracing all the
above improvements, with an increased speed, and increased
first-class passenger accommodation.</p>

<p>The Waterford Steamship Company were amongst the first
steamship owners to discard the bowsprit and figure-head,
and to adopt the straight stem. They were also amongst the
first owners to build steamers with saloons amidships, and it
is their proud boast that in the Liverpool and Waterford
service, extending over sixty years, they never lost a ship or
a human life.</p><br>

WHITE STAR LINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The White Star Line was founded about the middle of the last
century by the owners of a line of smart clippers sailing between
England and Australia. The great rush of adventurers to
the Australian gold diggings in the “fifties” gave a great
impetus to the trade between Great Britain and the Colonies.
In the course of seven years the White Star, Black Ball and
other lines carried about half a million passengers to the
Antipodes. The “White Star” boats, even in those days,
were the largest of their class, and amongst them were the
famous wooden clippers <span class="smcap">Golden Era</span>, <span class="smcap">Champion of the Seas</span>,
<span class="smcap">Blue Jacket</span>, and <span class="smcap">White Star</span>, vessels of from 3,000 to 4,500
tons gross. An important change took place in the destinies
of the line in 1867, when the managing owner retired, and the
late Thomas Henry Ismay took over the flag. Two years later
came the great event in the history of the White Star Line,
when Mr. Ismay induced some friends to join him in the
formation of the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company. It was
an enterprise boldly conceived, and carried out with great
judgment. Boldly conceived, for there were already four
companies each maintaining a regular weekly service between
Liverpool and New York. Nor were these small companies, or
of indifferent reputation. There was the Cunard Company,
established about thirty years previously; the Inman Line,
with a fine fleet of clipper passenger steamers; the Guion
Line, with its large American connections; and the National
Line, with its fleet of huge cargo carriers. In spite of this,
Mr. Ismay was confident that there was room for a high-class
Trans-Atlantic passenger service, and the shares in the new
company (£1,000 each fully paid) were at once privately taken
up by the firm of T. H. Ismay &amp; Co. and their friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
amongst whom were some of the most substantial names in
England. The following year Mr. Imrie (of the late firm of
Imrie, Tomlinson &amp; Co.) joined Mr. Ismay, and the style of
the firm was altered to Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The first step taken by the managers of the Oceanic Steam
Navigation Company was to arrange with the celebrated shipbuilders,
Messrs. Harland and Wolff, Belfast, for the construction
of a fleet of high-class steamships, expressly for the
American passenger trade. The pioneer vessel of the line
(the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span>) was launched on the 27th August, 1870, and
started on her maiden voyage under the White Star flag on the
2nd March, 1871. After running for several years between
Liverpool and New York, this steamer (<span class="smcap">Oceanic</span>, the first),
along with her sister ships, <span class="smcap">Gaelic</span> and <span class="smcap">Belgic</span>, were chartered
to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, of San
Francisco, to maintain a mail service between that port and
the Orient. The <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> was quickly followed on the
Liverpool-New York service by the <span class="smcap">Baltic</span>, <span class="smcap">Republic</span>,
<span class="smcap">Adriatic</span> and <span class="smcap">Celtic</span>, and weekly sailings from both ports
were instituted. These steamers were all of the one type,
straight stems, four masts, single funnel, and saloon amidships.
They proved themselves to be equal in speed and
superior in accommodation to any ships then afloat. Four
more steamers were added to the fleet in 1873, viz., the
<span class="smcap">Asiatic</span>, <span class="smcap">Tropic</span>, <span class="smcap">Gaelic</span> and <span class="smcap">Belgic</span>. A great advance on the
earlier steamships was made in 1874, when the <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> was
launched, followed by her sister ship, the <span class="smcap">Germanic</span>, in 1875.
Prior to the formation of the White Star Atlantic Fleet, the
passage between Liverpool and New York had averaged 9½
or 10 days, the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> and her consorts reduced it to about
8½ days, whilst the <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> and <span class="smcap">Germanic</span> brought the time
down to about 7½ days.</p>

<p>These vessels, with the exception of the two last named which
were larger and faster, were almost uniform in size and speed.
These, and the later vessels of the fleet, were designed and
built to attain the three-fold purpose of safety, speed and
comfort, and their performances have certainly realised the
expectations of their owners. Speed has been an important,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
but a secondary, consideration, as is shewn by the following
extract from the “Book of Regulations” of the White Star
Line of steamers:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The commanders must distinctly understand that the
issue of the following instructions does not, in any way,
relieve them from entire responsibility for the safe and
efficient navigation of their respective vessels; and they
are also enjoined to remember that, whilst they are
expected to use every diligence to secure a speedy
voyage, they must run no risk which might by any
possibility result in accident to their ships. It is to be
hoped that they will ever bear in mind that the safety of
the lives and property entrusted to their care is the
ruling principle that should govern them in the navigation
of their ships, and no supposed gain in expedition
or saving of time on the voyage is to be purchased at the
risk of accident. The company desires to establish and
maintain for its vessels a reputation for safety, and only
looks for such speed on the various voyages as is consistent
with safe and prudent navigation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Not content with giving this general regulation, the
managers have issued to the commanders of the respective
ships of the fleet a special autograph letter, laying special
emphasis on the supreme importance of extreme and
unvarying caution and prudence in the navigation of the company’s
vessels. The concluding paragraph of this letter is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Under all these circumstances of paramount and
engrossing interest to the company, whose property is
under your charge, we invite you to dismiss from your
mind all idea of competitive passages with other vessels,
the advantage of success in which is merely transient,
concentrating your whole attention upon a cautious,
prudent, and ever-watchful system of navigation
which shall lose time, or suffer any other temporary
inconvenience, rather than run the slightest risk which
can be avoided.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> when she first came out was fitted with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
novelty in the shape of a “lifting propeller.” This propeller
was a patent of the late Sir Edward Harland, senior partner of
the firm by whom the <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> was built. In long ships the
pitching in a heavy sea, and the vertical motion of the waves,
tend to expose the upper portion of the propeller, the evil
effects arising from this being the “racing” of the engines
and its attendant dangers, together with a diminished speed.
Sir Edward Harland believed that a propeller which could be
worked at any depth, and which did not require the stoppage of
the vessel whilst it was being raised or lowered, would reduce
these risks to a minimum, if it did not entirely remove them.
In actual practice, however, it was found that the advantages of
the new principle did not compensate for its disadvantages,
and, after a fair trial had been given to it, it was abandoned
in favour of the old style of screw. In a letter, dated 3rd
December, 1874, addressed to the late Mr. W. S. Lindsay,
Messrs. Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co. state:—“The average speed of the
<span class="smcap">Britannic</span> is fifteen knots per hour on a consumption of 75
to 80 tons of coal per day, and her approximate cost, built
without contract, is £200,000.”</p>

<p>From 1873 until 1884 the White Star Line maintained its
position as the fastest fleet on the Atlantic, a result to which
the <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> and <span class="smcap">Germanic</span> contributed in no small degree.
In September, 1890, the <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> eclipsed her own previous
record of 7 days 9½ hours, by crossing from New York to
Queenstown in 7 days 6 hours 55 minutes, at an average speed
of 16·80 knots. The following year (September, 1891) she
surpassed even this rapid passage, by making the run from
New York to Queenstown in 7 days 6 hours 52 minutes.
While employed by H.M. Government to convey troops
during the late war in South Africa, she made the run from
Queenstown to the Cape in 19 days, a speed surpassed by few
of the transports engaged. In August, 1891, the <span class="smcap">Germanic</span>
following in the track of her sister ship, travelled from New
York to Queenstown in 7 days 7 hours 37 minutes, at an
average speed of 16·10 knots per hour. When it is
remembered that this high speed (nearly nineteen statute
miles per hour) was attained by vessels over 20 years old, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
their original compound engines and boilers, it will be
acknowledged that, having regard to their small coal consumption
and large carrying capacity, the <span class="smcap">Britannic</span> and
<span class="smcap">Germanic</span> have given results unattainable with the fastest
ships of the present day.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Germanic</span> in 1895 received new engines and boilers,
and had her passenger quarters entirely remodelled on the
plan of the <span class="smcap">Majestic</span> and <span class="smcap">Teutonic</span>. In July of that year she
crossed from Queenstown to New York in 6 days 23 hours 45
minutes, and in August of the year following in 6 days 21
hours and 38 minutes, thus showing a substantial increase of
speed.</p>

<p>After the launch of these two famous steamers, there was an
interval of six years during which no new vessels were added
to the fleet. The next additions were the <span class="smcap">Arabic</span> and <span class="smcap">Coptic</span>,
for the Trans-Pacific trade, in 1881. In the same year Mr.
W. S. Graves, son of a well-known former M.P. for Liverpool,
became a partner.</p><br>

</figure>

<p>In 1883 the <span class="smcap">Ionic</span> and <span class="smcap">Doric</span> were built for the New
Zealand trade—the Shaw, Savill and Albion Line from
London. In 1885 the <span class="smcap">Gaelic</span> and <span class="smcap">Belgic</span>—replacing the two
older ships of the same names—were built for the Trans-Pacific
trade. A new type of steamer for the cargo and cattle
trade between Liverpool and New York was introduced in
1888, the two first steamers of the new type being the <span class="smcap">Cufic</span>
and <span class="smcap">Runic</span>. These vessels were the last single screw ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
ordered for the White Star Line, all the succeeding vessels
being of the twin-screw type. The <span class="smcap">Cufic</span> and <span class="smcap">Runic</span> proved
successful enough to warrant the company in forming a complete
service of cargo and cattle steamers. After doing very
efficient service as cattle carriers, the <span class="smcap">Cufic</span> was sold to a
Liverpool firm, who changed her name to the <span class="smcap">Manxman</span>, and
the <span class="smcap">Runic</span>, also sold to a Liverpool firm, is engaged in the
West Indian trade under the name of the <span class="smcap">Tampican</span>.</p>

<p>In January, 1889, was launched the <span class="smcap">Teutonic</span>, the first of
the celebrated pair of twin-screw mercantile armed cruisers
(<span class="smcap">Teutonic</span> and <span class="smcap">Majestic</span>), each 10,000 tons, which have since
made for themselves a great reputation in the New York
mail and passenger service. The keel of the <span class="smcap">Teutonic</span> was
laid in March, 1887. The vessel was launched 22 months
later, and she left Liverpool on her maiden voyage to New
York on the 7th August, 1889. Prior to going on to her
regular station, she was present, armed with eight quick-firing
guns, at the naval inspection by the German Emperor at
Spithead in the beginning of August, 1889. On that occasion
she astonished nautical critics with her splendid proportions,
and was honoured by a special visit from H.I.M. the Kaiser,
and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (now H.M. King Edward
VII.). She was again present with a large party of guests at
the Diamond Jubilee Naval Review in June, 1897, when she
carried an armament of 16 guns. Her sister ship, the
<span class="smcap">Majestic</span>, was launched on the 29th June, 1889, but did not
start on her first voyage until the 2nd April, 1890.</p>

<p>The length of time occupied in the building of these great
ships is sufficient evidence, if any were needed, of the great
care bestowed on their construction, and the builders, Messrs.
Harland &amp; Wolff, have their reward in witnessing the
successful work which is being performed by two of the finest
vessels the world has ever seen. These two beautiful vessels
quickly lowered the record on the Atlantic. In July, 1891,
the <span class="smcap">Majestic</span> steamed from Queenstown to New York in 5 days
18 hours and 8 minutes, the fastest passage then on record,
but even this was eclipsed by the <span class="smcap">Teutonic</span> the succeeding
month by a passage of 5 days 16½ hours duration.</p><br>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>On January 1st, 1891, Mr. Ismay’s two elder sons, Mr. J.
Bruce Ismay (previously the company’s agent in New York)
and Mr. James H. Ismay, were admitted members of the firm.
After 40 years’ business life Mr. T. H. Ismay, on the 31st
December, 1891, retired from the firm of Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co.,
but he continued to fill the position of chairman of the White
Star Line until his decease in November, 1899.</p>

<p>A large and handsome twin-screw passenger and mail
steamer, the <span class="smcap">Gothic</span>, of 7,755 tons, was added to the company’s
New Zealand fleet in 1893, and four years later (1897) the
<span class="smcap">Delphic</span>, 8,273 tons, a twin-screw cargo steamer, with accommodation
for one class of passengers only, was placed in the
New Zealand service.</p>

<p>Recognising that very considerable numbers of passengers are
willing to sacrifice speed to comfort and safety, the managers of
the White Star Line determined to make an innovation by
building a twin-screw cargo steamer of exceptional size and
power, fitted with accommodation for a limited number of
saloon and third-class passengers. The new steamer which
was called the <span class="smcap">Cymric</span>, commenced work in the Liverpool and
New York trade in 1898. Her tonnage is 13,096 tons gross.
Her passenger accommodation in both classes is excellent, and
she has proved a very attractive ship.</p>

<p>The autumn of 1899 was the most eventful period in the
history of the White Star Line. The Company, having sold
all its sailing ships formerly employed between England and
Australia, determined upon replacing them by a line of high-class
steamships, and the first steamer of the new line—the
<span class="smcap">Medic</span>, 11,984 tons—sailed from Liverpool for Australian ports
on the 3rd August. She was followed by the <span class="smcap">Afric</span>, <span class="smcap">Persic</span>,
<span class="smcap">Runic</span> and <span class="smcap">Suevic</span>. All these five vessels are approximately of
the same size, propelled by twin screws, and maintain a regular
monthly service between Liverpool and Australia, via the Cape.
The first return voyage of the <span class="smcap">Medic</span> was taken advantage of
by the Australian Government for the conveyance of the first
contingent of Colonial troops and horses to the Cape. Intense
public interest was excited by the arrival, in the Mersey from
Belfast of the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span>, the second, on Saturday, 27th August,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
1899, but almost at the moment of their greatest triumph the
White Star Line suffered the irreparable loss of the founder of
the Company. Mr. T. H. Ismay passed away, after a severe
illness lasting three months, on the 23rd November, 1899. The
extent of the loss caused by his death to the community at
large, was very feelingly expressed by the “Times,” in its
issue of the following day.</p>

<p>The second <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool
to New York on the 6th September, 1899. The following
description of her appeared in the “Liverpool Daily Post” of
31st August, 1899:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Big as she is, the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> appeared nothing remarkable
as she lay yesterday in the Canada Dock,
while coal was being poured into her bunkers from eight
grimy barges lying alongside. This was because the
Liverpool docks are themselves gigantic. It was only
when, from the bridge of the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span>, 66 feet above the
water-line, one looked down upon the whole length of
the vessel and upon the expanse of docks and sheds, that
her size was realised. On the opposite side of the dock
was the <span class="smcap">Cymric</span>, from the depths of which a horde of
labourers were discharging cargo. Now the <span class="smcap">Cymric</span> is
the largest cargo steamer in the world, 2,500 tons larger
than either the <span class="smcap">Majestic</span> or <span class="smcap">Teutonic</span>. But from the
<span class="smcap">Oceanic’s</span> bridge she looked positively like a coaster.
One looked down upon her busy decks as one might look
from the roof of a house into a street. Why the bulk
of the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> is not the first thing that strikes the
attention, is because her lines are graceful. She is huge,
but she is not elephantine. Her masts, even at the point
where they enter the top mast or spar deck, are nearly
three feet in diameter, that is, they are as high and as
thick as patriarchal oak; but from a near distance they
look slim and tapering. The same may be said of the
ship’s boats which are as big as barges. The fact is,
that everything about this latest creation of shipping
enterprise is proportioned so beautifully that the mere
hugeness of it all is only apprehended by remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
such facts as, that her rudder and stern frame weigh 150
tons; that 100 tons of cable lie coiled on her foc’sle deck;
that she is composed of 17,000 steel plates, many
weighing from two to three and a quarter tons; that her
promenade deck is 400 feet long; and that her monster
engines can move with the power of 28,000 horses. To
look down into the engine room from the big sky-light
on the top deck is to have a glimpse into a world that
to people not used to shipping is one of strange activity;
a world where diminutive human ants are moving in a
tropical atmosphere across narrow bridges, busy preparing
this Brobdignagian apparatus for its first
struggle with the forces of the wide Atlantic, which the
<span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> is to cross with the speed and certainty of an
express train—the conquest of the mighty force of
matter by the mighty force of mind....</p>

<p>“But much has been written already of the ship as a
triumph of science; the more immediate purpose here
is to speak of her as a triumph of art, as the last thing,
so far, in the way of floating hotels.... State rooms
in scores to the right and to the left; now mahogany,
now oak; now satinwood; now a mixture of any two or
three of them, until the lavishness of everything became
surfeiting, notwithstanding that the Louis Quinze style
succeeded the Queen Anne, and the Queen Anne gave
place to something ‘too utter’ in decadent sumptuousness.
Three decks of these apartments, with lavatories
of costly marble, suites of baths, and every other
appurtenance of physical comfort placed conveniently
here and there. It is the literal truth to say that the
<span class="smcap">Oceanic</span> is a Hotel Cecil afloat.”</p>
</div>

<p>It would serve no purpose to weary the reader with a
decorator’s specification, but the following are the dimensions
of the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span>, and of the principal apartments on
board:—</p>

<p>The library, on the promenade deck, has a length of 53 feet
and a width of 40 feet.</p>

<p>The saloon is 80 feet by 64 feet. The central glass dome is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>21 feet square, and is divided up by golden ribs and filled in
with white ground glass of a pearly appearance.</p><br>

<p>Mr. Harold Arthur Sanderson, who had occupied the
position of general manager to Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co. for five
years, was admitted a partner on the 1st January, 1900.
The <span class="smcap">Celtic</span>, a monster steamer of 20,904 tons gross, was
added to the fleet in 1901. A sister ship to the <span class="smcap">Celtic</span> was
launched at Belfast on the 21st August, 1902. The new vessel
is named the <span class="smcap">Cedric</span>, and has the distinction of exceeding in
size anything afloat, British or foreign. Like the <span class="smcap">Celtic</span>, she
is classed as an intermediate ship, not so fast as the <span class="smcap">Oceanic</span>,
but yet speedy. Her length is 700 feet and her beam 75 feet,
with a gross tonnage of 21,000 tons. She sailed on her first
voyage from Liverpool on the 11th February, 1903.</p><br>

<p>In 1902 Mr. J. P. Morgan succeeded in welding into one
huge commercial undertaking, with a capital of £32,000,000,
several of the principal Transatlantic steamship companies,
including the famous White Star Line. The purchase money
for the latter alone exceeded ten millions sterling, three
millions of which was payable in cash on the 31st December,
1902, and, as a matter of fact, was actually paid at the offices
of Messrs. J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., in London, on the 1st
December, 1902.</p>

<p>It was a sincere satisfaction to the British public when it
was officially intimated that the White Star flag was still to be
retained, and that Mr. J. Bruce Ismay and Mr. Pirrie (the
senior partner of the celebrated Belfast shipbuilding firm)
were to be on the directorate.</p>

<p>The latest addition to the New York service of the White
Star Line is the <span class="smcap">Arabic</span>, 15,800 tons gross register, which
sailed on her maiden voyage, June 26th, 1903, and in
the autumn of 1903 the four latest steamers built for the
Dominion Line, the <span class="smcap">Columbus</span>, <span class="smcap">Commonwealth</span>, <span class="smcap">New
England</span> and <span class="smcap">Mayflower</span>, were transferred to the White Star
flag, and renamed the <span class="smcap">Republic</span>, <span class="smcap">Canopic</span>, <span class="smcap">Romanic</span> and
<span class="smcap">Cretic</span>. With the addition of these vessels, a new service has
been announced of sailings between Boston and the principal
ports in the Mediterranean, and, in conjunction with the other
steamships, the <span class="smcap">Cymric</span> is intended to maintain a Liverpool-Boston
service.</p>

<p>A monster steamer of no less than 24,000 tons (an increase of
3,000 tons upon the <span class="smcap">Cedric</span>’s tonnage) is approaching completion
at the yard of Harland &amp; Wolff. She is to be named the
<span class="smcap">Baltic</span>, and will probably be ready early in the summer of
1904.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The following firms hold a prominent position in their
respective trades—Foreign and Coastwise—and most of them
have been established for many years:—</p>


<p>The <b>Adelaide Steamship Co., Lim.</b>, was established in
October, 1875, its nominal capital being £100,000. In November,
1882, the capital of the Company was increased to
£300,000, and in December, 1900, a further reconstruction of
the Company occurred, the capital being increased to £750,000.
The first two steamers built for the Company were the <span class="smcap">South
Australian</span> and the <span class="smcap">Victorian</span>. Each was slightly over 400
tons register, making a total of 900 tons; whereas the present
capacity of the Company’s fleet (consisting of 25 steamers) is
about 50,000 tons. The steamers, on their various routes, trade
to and from nearly every port on the Australian seaboard.
Amongst the vessels owned by the Adelaide Steamship Co. is
the <span class="smcap">Ferret</span>, whose romantic story is told in the first part of
this volume. (See ante, page <a href="#Page_137">137</a>).</p>


<p><b>John Bacon, Lim.</b>—This firm was established about the
middle of the last century by the late Mr. John Bacon. Mr.
Bacon died in 1886, and three years later the business was
formed into a Limited Company. The fleet of the Company at
the present date consists of the steamers <span class="smcap">Eden Vale</span>, <span class="smcap">Edith</span>,
<span class="smcap">Heptarchy</span>, <span class="smcap">Prestonian</span>, <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>, <span class="smcap">Sunlight</span>, <span class="smcap">Talbot</span>, <span class="smcap">Tudor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></span>,
<span class="smcap">Vigilant</span>, and <span class="smcap">Wexford</span>. These steamers maintain regular
sailings between Liverpool and Wexford, Liverpool and the
Bristol Channel Ports, &amp;c.</p>


<p><b>R. Burton &amp; Sons.</b>—The firm of R. Burton &amp; Sons was
founded by the late Mr. R. Burton, of Newport, Mon., over one
hundred years ago, and since 1840 has been carried on by his
three sons. In 1898 the business was transferred to a Limited
Company, with a capital of £100,000, the major portion of the
shares being retained by the Messrs. Burton. The Company
maintains regular services between Liverpool and various ports
in the Bristol Channel, a daily service between Bristol and
Cardiff, and a daily service between Bristol and Newport, Mon.</p>


<p><b>Fletcher, Woodhill &amp; Co.</b>—This firm was established at Manchester,
in 1893, by Mr. H. A. Fletcher (of Liverpool) and
Captain T. J. Woodhill (of Sunderland). Since the opening of
the Ship Canal Messrs. Fletcher, Woodhill &amp; Co. have taken
an active part in the steamship business of the port of Manchester.
Their present services are between Manchester and
France; Manchester, Portugal and Spain; and Manchester
and Italy.</p>


<p><b>T. &amp; J. Harrison.</b>—This important Steamship Company
maintains regular sailings from Liverpool to Calcutta, New
Orleans, Galveston, Brazil and West Indies, and South of
France; also joint sailings of Ellerman-Harrison Line from
Glasgow and Liverpool to South and East Africa. The fleet at
the present date (1904) consists of 36 full-powered steamships,
exclusive of two steamers building, with an aggregate gross
tonnage of 179,166 tons:—<span class="smcap">Actor</span>, <span class="smcap">Barrister</span>, <span class="smcap">Capella</span>,
<span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>, <span class="smcap">Civilian</span>, <span class="smcap">Cognac</span>, <span class="smcap">Collegian</span>, <span class="smcap">Colonial</span>,

<span class="smcap">Yeoman</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>


<p><b>W. S. Kennaugh &amp; Co.</b> commenced business of steamship
owners at a time when sailing vessels were being displaced in
the general coasting trade by steamers. The first boat built for
the firm was the <span class="smcap">Scale Force</span>, famous in her day for her large
carrying powers on a low net register. She was designed by a
brother of the senior partner of the firm, by whom all the
succeeding steamers have been designed. The names of the
steamers at the present date owned by this firm are the <span class="smcap">Aira
Force</span>, <span class="smcap">Birker Force</span>, <span class="smcap">Holme Force</span>, and <span class="smcap">Stanley Force</span>.</p>


<p><b>Lamport &amp; Holt Line.</b>—The Liverpool, Brazil and River
Plate Steam Navigation Co., Limited, better known as the
“Lamport &amp; Holt” Line, was formed in 1865, the first
Managers of the Line being the late Mr. William James
Lamport, and Mr. George Holt. This Company is one of the
largest of the Steamship Companies of Liverpool, at which Port
its headquarters are situated. It owns a fleet, of thirty-nine
full-powered modern cargo steamers, ranging from 1,671 tons
to 6,508 tons, the average per steamer being 3,375 tons and the
aggregate tonnage 131,654 tons gross register, representing a
total dead weight carrying capacity of about 200,000 tons.</p>

<p>The Company has given special attention to the transit of
cattle to and from the River Plate, in which trade it has nine
steamers, specially built for this service, having permanent
fittings for the conveyance of live-stock.</p>

<p>These vessels have a most satisfactory record for the carriage
of the cattle shipped by them. Live stock are also carried
between New York and Manchester by boats specially adapted
to the requirements of the North Atlantic Trade.</p>

<p>All the steamers of the Lamport and Holt fleet are fitted with
the most modern appliances for the rapid and effective handling
of general cargo. The operations of the Company are varied
and extensive and comprise the following regular services:—From
Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool to Bahia, Rio de
Janeiro and Santos, fortnightly. From London and Antwerp
to Rio de Janeiro and Santos, every ten days. From New
York (carrying first and third-class passengers) to Pernambuco,
Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santos, fortnightly. Also to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
River Plate from Liverpool, fortnightly; from Glasgow,
monthly; from London and Antwerp, fortnightly; and from
New York at frequent intervals. A regular monthly service
is also maintained between Liverpool, Glasgow, and West Coast
ports in Chili, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>

<p>The steamers of this Line have always been very popular with
shippers, who are able to depend upon regularity of service,
and careful handling of their goods.</p>


<p><b>H. &amp; W. Nelson, Limited.</b>—This remarkably successful
Company was founded in 1889, by Messrs. Hugh and William
Nelson.</p>

<p>The pioneer steamer of the fleet was the steamer <span class="smcap">Spindrift</span>,
now the <span class="smcap">Highland Scot</span>, which sailed from Liverpool on her
maiden voyage on the 12th December, 1889.</p><br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p3180_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p3180_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center fs80 no-indent"><span class="smcap">Highland Brigade s.s.</span> H. &amp; W. Nelson, Limited.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A few months later (May, 1890) the second steamer of the
line, the <span class="smcap">Highland Chief</span>, was launched, and the following
year three additional steamers were built for the Company, and
named respectively the <span class="smcap">Highland Glen</span>, <span class="smcap">Highland Lassie</span> and
<span class="smcap">Highland Mary</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>Since that date, nine vessels (including three now building)
have been added to the fleet, which consists of fourteen
powerful modern steamships of large carrying capacity. These
steamers are all very similar in design (though several are
much larger) to the <span class="smcap">Highland Enterprise</span>, of which particulars
are given below.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Highland Enterprise</span> was launched in January of the
present year (1903). She is 385 feet long, between perpendiculars;
with 45 feet beam, and draft laden 23 feet 6 inches. She
has a carrying capacity of 6,500 tons. Like her sister ships,
she is insulated throughout for carrying frozen meat, and fitted
with the latest type of refrigerating machinery, as well as the
most up-to date appliances for the effective handling of general
cargo. Accommodation has been provided amidships for about
a dozen passengers. Her engines, which are of the triple-expansion
type, propelled her on her trial trip at a speed equal
to 13¾ knots per hour.</p>

<p>In addition to a regular fortnightly service between Liverpool
and Monte Video, Buenos Ayres and Rosario, the steamers
of the Nelson Line sail at regular monthly intervals from
London and Newport (Mon.) to the River Plate.</p>

<p><b>R. &amp; J. H. Rea.</b>—In 1872 Mr. Russell Rea (the present M.P.
for the City of Gloucester), commenced business as a coal
merchant in Liverpool. After a lapse of seven years (1879),
he admitted his brother, Mr. James Rea, into partnership,
and the style of the firm was altered to R. &amp; J. H. Rea.
The firm own a fleet of five powerful modern coasting steamers,
each having a capacity of about 2,500 tons dead weight, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
named respectively the <span class="smcap">Bangarth</span>, <span class="smcap">Calgarth</span>, <span class="smcap">Dalegarth</span>,
<span class="smcap">Gatesgarth</span>, and <span class="smcap">Throstlegarth</span>. In addition to these
vessels, the firm possesses five steam tugs and about 200
lighters. Messrs. R. &amp; J. H. Rea have offices at London,
Liverpool, Southampton, Bristol and Cardiff.</p>


<p><b>John S. Sellers.</b>—Mr. Sellers commenced business as a steamship
owner at Liverpool in the early nineties, the first steamer
acquired by him being the <span class="smcap">Timbo</span>. Although for a short time
employed as a “tramp” she was soon placed in a regular
general cargo trade, and during the past ten years she has
maintained, with every satisfaction to shippers and consignees,
the service between Liverpool and Preston. Mr. Sellers has
also established a regular trade between Harlingen (Holland)
and Liverpool, and since early in 1900 he has built up a regular
weekly service between Glasgow and Preston, which is well
served by the <span class="smcap">Thursby</span> and other steamers.</p>


<p><b>Henry Tyrer &amp; Co.</b>—Mr. Henry Tyrer, the sole partner in
this firm, commenced business in 1878, in Liverpool, and in
1892 opened a branch office at Preston. The Albert Edward
Dock at Preston, was opened by the late Duke of Edinburgh
in June of that year, and immediately after the opening
ceremony, the steamer <span class="smcap">Lady Louisa</span>, chartered by Messrs.
Henry Tyrer &amp; Co., commenced discharging, being thus the
first steamer to unload in Preston Dock. This firm has
continued from that date to be closely associated with the steam
trade of Preston. In 1899 Messrs. Henry Tyrer &amp; Co. built the
steamer <span class="smcap">Prestonian</span>, the first steamer to bear that name,
shortly afterwards disposing of her to Messrs. John Bacon,
Limited, in whose service she is still employed. The following
year (1900) Messrs. Henry Tyrer &amp; Co. purchased the steamship
<span class="smcap">Hermann</span>, of about 1,300 tons deadweight, which is regularly
employed in the firm’s wood pulp trade from Baltic ports. The
small steamer <span class="smcap">Princess</span> was purchased the same year for
employment in the firm’s regular London and Preston general
cargo trade. In 1901 the steamer <span class="smcap">Prestonian</span>, the first, was
replaced by a new steamer of 1,600 tons deadweight, also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
named the <span class="smcap">Prestonian</span>, and which, like the <span class="smcap">Hermann</span>, is
regularly engaged in the firm’s wood pulp trade.</p>

<p>During the present year (1903) the firm bought the steamer
<span class="smcap">Minterne</span>, and re-named her the <span class="smcap">Nancy Lee</span>. She is a large
steamer of about 4,750 tons deadweight, and has proved herself
to be an excellent sea boat. A remarkable incident in connection
with this ship is, that she has been chartered for six
years, to run consecutive voyages between the Saguenay River
(Canada) and the U. K., at a fixed rate of freight covering the
whole period. In addition to their offices at Liverpool and
Preston, Messrs. Henry Tyrer &amp; Co. have also branch offices at
London and Manchester, in connection with their extensive and
largely developing wood pulp trade.</p><br>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
